## Original Capture

let's think through how a cub investigate command could trawl through captures and figure out what it could do with the ideas. some things are simple and can just be executed (or batched for execution) as bug fixes / small improvements, other things could be researched and thought about for feedback and signoff, then slotted for build and release, some things could be researched or explored through a variety of investigation tools. other things might just need clarification. but the goal would be moving the ball forward on different ideas
