clear cub onboarding and entry points

#task
only edit our part of AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md. we should expect that people have other stuff they want to include in there.

we should add a doctor routine that looks to see if a combination of instructions in one of these files leads to confusion for the harness in a way that potentially affects what we're trying to do.

walkthrough video

* using AI tools in 2026 is a mix of ecstasy and agony. you can "one-shot" apps in minutes, but you also find features that weren't wired up, etc. 

* as the underlying models and tools rapidly improve, we're all learning how to use them in new and creative ways.

* cub helps you avoid pitfalls by wrapping AI coding tools with the right mix of scaffolding: prompts, commands and code, to help you work on your projects end-to-end: from the vision of a new project or feature or fixing a bug all the way through planning, development, and production.

* generating code was once scarce and is now abundant, and that means everything around code generation needs to be re-tooled. 

* cub is designed to help you end-to-end: from the seed of an idea (starting a new project or a cool new feature, or fixing bugs) through the planning and development stages all the way through to production.

* reasonable defaults, a.k.a. strong opinions, weakly held
** cub works out-of-the-box

* a holistic view of a "project"
** cub-based git repos store code, docs and tests as well as tasks, plans, prompts, and dev logs all in one place. this allows AI tools and humans to get a more complete picture of why and how a system is being developed, not just what was created.

* durability over raw speed
** the idea of generating an entire functional app in 15 minutes is tantalizing, but it doesn't help in the long run if that app needs to be rebuilt 5 times. cub helps you take a more methodical approach to building apps. it does more to test code and update docs.

#task
cut-release.sh should follow some kind of best practice for cutting a feature branch to do the change log and things like that and then get the sequencing to merging down to main correctly relative to when the release is cut. I want to just follow whatever makes sense as good standard best practices here.

we should also ensure the title starts with the version number (e.g. v0.31.2 - Spectral Projection)
