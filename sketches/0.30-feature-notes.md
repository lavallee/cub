clear cub onboarding and entry points


## Task Stack

---

#task
only edit our part of AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md. we should expect that people have other stuff they want to include in there.

we should add a doctor routine that looks to see if a combination of instructions in one of these files leads to confusion for the harness in a way that potentially affects what we're trying to do.

* using AI tools in 2026 is a mix of ecstasy and agony. you can "one-shot" apps in minutes, but you also find features that weren't wired up, etc. 

* as the underlying models and tools rapidly improve, we're all learning how to use them in new and creative ways.

* cub helps you avoid pitfalls by wrapping AI coding tools with the right mix of scaffolding: prompts, commands and code, to help you work on your projects end-to-end: from the vision of a new project or feature or fixing a bug all the way through planning, development, and production.

* generating code was once scarce and is now abundant, and that means everything around code generation needs to be re-tooled. 

* cub is designed to help you end-to-end: from the seed of an idea (starting a new project or a cool new feature, or fixing bugs) through the planning and development stages all the way through to production.

* reasonable defaults, a.k.a. strong opinions, weakly held
** cub works out-of-the-box

* a holistic view of a "project"
** cub-based git repos store code, docs and tests as well as tasks, plans, prompts, and dev logs all in one place. this allows AI tools and humans to get a more complete picture of why and how a system is being developed, not just what was created.

* durability over raw speed
** the idea of generating an entire functional app in 15 minutes is tantalizing, but it doesn't help in the long run if that app needs to be rebuilt 5 times. cub helps you take a more methodical approach to building apps. it does more to test code and update docs.

## In progress

#task
cut-release.sh should follow some kind of best practice for cutting a feature branch to do the change log and things like that and then get the sequencing to merging down to main correctly relative to when the release is cut. I want to just follow whatever makes sense as good standard best practices here.

we should also ensure the title starts with the version number (e.g. v0.31.2 - Spectral Projection)

#task

Let's be smart about when somebody asks for a command that is a switch, for instance, dash dash help versus command help or command version versus dash dash version. We can create synonyms since we have a decent understanding of what they mean. We can just be helpful instead of erroring out. Similarly, let's figure out how to make some of the global switches like dash dash debug able to show up anywhere on the command line having to only understand it when it immediately follows cub is a bit confusing since things like dash dash debug dash dash verbose etc. should be able to be applied pretty much anywhere as flags.

#task
let's add a simple 'cub docs' command that tries to launch a web browser to our documentation site, and failing that, provide the URL on the c
ommand line.
