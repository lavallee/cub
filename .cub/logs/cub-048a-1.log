Running claude...
I'll start by understanding the current models structure and then implement the PlanEntry and RunEntry models according to the architecture spec.
Let me read the architecture spec to understand the required fields for PlanEntry and RunEntry:
Great! Now I have a clear understanding of the requirements. Let me mark the task as in progress and implement the PlanEntry and RunEntry models:
Let me search for the specific task:
Good! The task is already marked as in_progress. Now let me implement the PlanEntry and RunEntry models based on the architecture spec:
Now let me add the PlanEntry and RunEntry models at the end of the models.py file:
Now let me update the __init__.py to export these new models:
Now let's run the feedback loops to ensure everything works correctly:
I need to fix the type annotation for the dict field. Let me update it:
Great! Now let's run the full type check on the ledger package:
That's an existing issue with yaml stubs, not related to my changes. Let me verify the models can be imported and serialized:
Perfect! Now let's test status field validation with Literal types:
Excellent! Now let's run the test suite to make sure we haven't broken anything:
Let me find the actual test files:
Great! Now let's run a broader test suite to make sure nothing is broken:
Perfect! All tests pass. Now let's run the linter:
Great! All linting checks pass. Now let me mark the task as closed:
Now let's commit the changes:
