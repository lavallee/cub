I'll implement the HTTPAdapter by first understanding the existing codebase structure and patterns, then creating the new adapter.Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the existing code. Let me read the key files to understand the implementation details:Now let me check what existing tests look like to understand the testing patterns:Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the HTTPAdapter implementation. I'll create the adapters package and implement the HTTP adapter with retry logic.Now I'll create the HTTPAdapter implementation:Good! Now let me create comprehensive tests for the HTTPAdapter. First, let me check if there's an existing test file structure:Now let me create comprehensive tests for the HTTPAdapter:Excellent! Now let's run the tests to make sure everything works:I see the issue - pytest needs to properly handle async tests. Let me check how other tests handle async:Good, I see that `@pytest.mark.asyncio` is used. But the tests are complaining about the marker. Let me check the pytest configuration:The issue is that pytest is using strict markers and `asyncio` is not registered. Let me check if pytest-asyncio is installed and configure it properly. First, let me look at conftest.py:I see - pytest-asyncio is available (from imports) but I need to configure it properly. Let me update conftest.py to enable asyncio:Now I need to also register the asyncio marker in pyproject.toml:Great! Now let's run the tests again:I need to install pytest-asyncio. Let me revert the conftest change and use anyio instead which is already installed:Now let me update the pytest config to use anyio instead of pytest-asyncio:Now let me run the tests to see what happens:Good! The synchronous tests pass. Now I need to install pytest-asyncio to run the async tests. Let me check if it's available:It's already installed globally! The issue is it's not in the virtual environment. Let me install it:Let me check how other tests handle async. Let me look at the working async test file:Let me check which Python package manager should be used:Let me check how the project is set up:Let me try a different approach - use uv which seems to be the package manager:Perfect! Now let's run the async tests:Excellent! All tests pass! Now let's run the feedback loops:Perfect! All tests pass. Now let's run type checking:Excellent! Now let's run linting:Let me fix these linting issues:Now let me fix the test file:Now fix the long lines:Now fix the other long line:Now let's run linting again:Perfect! Now let's run all tests to make sure nothing broke:Excellent! All tests pass. Let's also run the mypy check again to ensure everything is properly typed:Perfect! Now let's close the task and commit the changes:Now let's commit the changes:Perfect! Now let's append learnings to progress.txt:Perfect! Let's check if there are more tasks to work on:Let's check which tasks are ready to work on:Great! The task is complete. Let me check the task details one more time to verify we completed everything:Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me create a summary for the user:

## Task Complete: cub-x7f.3 - Implement HTTPAdapter ✓

I have successfully implemented the HTTPAdapter with comprehensive retry logic and error handling. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Summary

**Created Files:**
1. `src/cub/core/tools/adapters/__init__.py` - Package initialization
2. `src/cub/core/tools/adapters/http.py` - HTTPAdapter implementation (403 lines)
3. `tests/test_tools_http_adapter.py` - Comprehensive test suite (34 tests)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 retries, configurable)
- ✅ Smart error classification (timeout, auth, network, rate_limit, validation)
- ✅ HTTP status code mapping to semantic error types
- ✅ Response parsing (JSON with fallback to text)
- ✅ Markdown summary generation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with detailed metadata
- ✅ Full integration with existing `retry_request()` utility

**Error Type Mapping:**
- 401/403 → `auth`
- 429 → `rate_limit`
- 400-499 → `validation`
- 500-599 → `network`
- Timeouts → `timeout`
- Connection errors → `network`

### Quality Assurance

**All feedback loops passed:**
- ✅ Tests: 34/34 HTTPAdapter tests passing
- ✅ Tests: 69/69 total tools module tests passing
- ✅ Type checking: mypy passed (no issues)
- ✅ Linting: ruff passed (all checks)

### Additional Work

**Configuration Updates:**
- Added `pytest-asyncio` marker to `pyproject.toml`
- Installed `pytest-asyncio` via `uv pip install`

### Next Steps

The following P0 tasks are ready to work on:
- `cub-x7f.4` - Implement CLIAdapter
- `cub-x7f.5` - Create ExecutionService
- `cub-m3k.1` - Define ToolConfig and Registry models
