I'll implement the core ID models package. Let me start by understanding the current project structure and then implement the required components.Now let me read a specific portion of the tasks file to understand the task structure:Let me read the specific task entry:Good, the task is already marked as "in_progress". Now let me check if there are any existing ID-related files or specifications to understand the format:Let me read the spec file to understand the ID format:Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of the ID format. Let me also check the architecture document:Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let me check if there are existing tests to understand the testing patterns:Perfect! Now let me look at a simple test example to understand the testing patterns:Good! Now let me check if there are existing Pydantic models to understand the pattern:Let me look at one example to understand the pattern:Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to implement the ID models. Let me create the package structure and implement the models:Now let me create the models.py file with all five ID models:Now let me create the __init__.py file to export the public API:Perfect! Now let me create comprehensive tests for these models:Perfect! Now let's run the tests to make sure everything works:Excellent! All tests pass. Now let's run the feedback loops (typecheck, lint):Perfect! All feedback loops pass. Let me also run the full test suite to ensure I haven't broken anything:Great! The tests are running well. Let me check if all tests pass (I'll just run a quick summary):Perfect! All tests pass (5310 passed, 17 skipped). Now let's update the task status to "closed" in the tasks.jsonl file:Let me try a different approach:Perfect! Now let's verify the update:Excellent! Now let's commit our changes:I need to remove the cache files and run-sessions from the commit since those are not intended to be committed:Good! Now let's commit the changes with the proper format:Perfect! Let's verify the commit:Excellent! The task is complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Complete: cub-048a-0.1 ✓

I have successfully implemented the core/ids/ package with ID models, which is the foundation of the hierarchical ID system.

### What Was Delivered

**Files Created:**
1. `src/cub/core/ids/__init__.py` - Public API exports
2. `src/cub/core/ids/models.py` - Five ID model implementations
3. `tests/core/ids/__init__.py` - Test package initialization
4. `tests/core/ids/test_models.py` - Comprehensive test suite (30 tests)

**ID Models Implemented:**
1. **SpecId** - `cub-054` format (project-{number:03d})
2. **PlanId** - `cub-054A` format (spec + letter A-Z,a-z,0-9)
3. **EpicId** - `cub-054A-0` format (plan-char where char is 0-9,a-z,A-Z)
4. **TaskId** - `cub-054A-0.1` format (epic.number)
5. **StandaloneTaskId** - `cub-s017` format (project-s{number:03d})

### Key Features
- ✅ All models use Pydantic v2 with strict validation
- ✅ Immutable models (frozen=True)
- ✅ Proper string formatting via `__str__` methods
- ✅ Validation for letter/char fields with helpful error messages
- ✅ Full type safety with mypy --strict compliance
- ✅ Hierarchical composition (task → epic → plan → spec)

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **Tests**: 30 tests, all passing (100% coverage)
- ✅ **Type Check**: `mypy --strict` passes with no errors
- ✅ **Lint**: `ruff check` passes with no issues
- ✅ **Integration**: Full test suite (5310 tests) still passing

### Acceptance Criteria Met
All acceptance criteria from the task specification have been met:
- ✅ All five ID models implemented with proper validation
- ✅ `str(SpecId(project="cub", number=54))` returns `"cub-054"`
- ✅ `str(TaskId(...))` returns `"cub-054A-0.1"` format
- ✅ Invalid letter/char values raise ValidationError
- ✅ Models are immutable (frozen=True)

The implementation is committed and ready for the next task in the epic (cub-048a-0.2: Implement ID parser and validator).
