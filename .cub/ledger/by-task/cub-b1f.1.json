    "description": "Users inside a harness session need to discover what cub skills are available. A `/cub` meta-skill lists available skills, common commands, and current project status.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Create `.claude/commands/cub.md` as the meta-skill\n2. Include: list of available `/cub:*` skills with one-line descriptions\n3. Include: common `cub` CLI commands runnable via Bash (task ready, status, run)\n4. Include: brief explanation of modes (conversational, structured, supervised, autonomous)\n5. Include: dynamic project state (injected via template variables or by running `cub status`)\n\n**Files:** .claude/commands/cub.md",
