    "description": "The router skill needs to reference the compiled routes file so Claude can use frequency data as a tiebreaker for ambiguous intent. This is the only point where LLM judgment enters the route learning system.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Add a \"Learned Routes\" section to `.claude/commands/cub.md`:\n2. Place this section after the \"Execution Rules\" section and before \"Examples\"\n3. The `@` prefix ensures Claude Code injects the file content into context\n\n**Files:** .claude/commands/cub.md",
