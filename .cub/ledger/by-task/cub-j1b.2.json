    "description": "Every `TaskBackend` method must delegate to both backends. Write operations go to both; read operations query both and compare.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Implement all 13 protocol methods with delegation\n2. For write methods (create, update, close, add_note, import): execute on both\n3. For read methods (list, get, get_ready, get_counts): query both and compare\n4. Return primary backend's result in all cases\n5. Catch exceptions from secondary (log but don't fail)\n6. Handle case where secondary doesn't have a task that primary does\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/tasks/both.py`",
