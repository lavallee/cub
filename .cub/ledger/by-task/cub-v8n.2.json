    "description": "Hook handlers currently write raw forensics. They need to also drive the `SessionLedgerIntegration` so events flow through to the ledger on session end.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. In `handle_session_start`: instantiate `SessionLedgerIntegration`, call `on_session_start()`\n2. In `handle_post_tool_use`: after writing forensics, call `on_file_write()`, `on_task_close()`, or `on_git_commit()` as appropriate\n3. In `handle_stop`: call `on_session_end()` which reconstructs state from forensics and synthesizes ledger entry\n4. Each hook invocation is a separate process -- `SessionLedgerIntegration` reconstructs from forensics JSONL each time\n5. Ensure `LedgerWriter` is properly initialized with project directory from hook payload `cwd`\n\n**Files:** src/cub/core/harness/hooks.py, tests/test_harness_hooks_integration.py",
