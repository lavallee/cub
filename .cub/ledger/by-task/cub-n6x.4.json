    "description": "When build-plan creates a feature branch, it doesn't set upstream tracking, causing `git push` to fail with \"fatal: The current branch has no upstream branch.\" Users must manually run `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>` before subsequent pushes work. This friction breaks the autonomous workflow where agents should be able to push changes without manual git intervention.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Locate the feature branch creation logic in build-plan (likely in `cub.core.launch` or a related module that handles git operations)\n2. After creating the local branch, immediately configure upstream tracking by either:",
