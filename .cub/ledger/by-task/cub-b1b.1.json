    "description": "`core/review/reporter.py` is the heaviest Rich violator \u2014 it's ~90% Rich rendering. The data models already exist in `core/review/models.py`. We need to split data preparation from rendering.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Audit `core/review/reporter.py` to identify data preparation vs rendering\n2. Keep any data transformation logic in core; move to `core/review/formatter.py` if needed (returns structured data)\n3. Create `cli/review/display.py` with all Rich rendering (Panel, Table, Text)\n4. Update `cli/review.py` to call display functions instead of core reporter\n5. Remove Rich imports from `core/review/reporter.py` (or delete if fully moved)\n6. Update tests to verify data output, not rendered output\n\n**Files:** src/cub/core/review/reporter.py, src/cub/cli/review/display.py, src/cub/cli/review.py",
