Create `src/cub/core/release/` package with `service.py`\n2. Implement `ReleaseService` with methods:\n3. Create `src/cub/cli/release.py` with Typer command\n4. Add `--dry-run` flag to preview changes\n5. Add `--no-tag` flag to skip git tag creation\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/release/__init__.py`, `src/cub/core/release/service.py`, `src/cub/cli/release.py`",

    "approach": "Implemented the `cub release` command by creating a service layer (`ReleaseService`) to handle release logic independently, then exposing it through a CLI command with `--dry-run` and `--no-tag` flags. The service handles moving specs to `specs/released/`, updating CHANGELOG.md, creating git tags, and updating ledger status\u2014all with clear separation of concerns between domain logic and CLI presentation.",

      "**Service-first pattern**: Implemented business logic in `ReleaseService` before CLI to maintain testability and enable reuse by other interfaces (API, skills)",
