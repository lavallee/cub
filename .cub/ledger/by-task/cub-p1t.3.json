    "description": "JsonlBackend operates on an in-memory task list with atomic file writes. New methods manipulate task fields directly using existing Task model methods (`add_label()`, `remove_label()`, `reopen()`).\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. `add_dependency(task_id, depends_on)` \u2014 find task, append to `depends_on` list, save\n2. `remove_dependency(task_id, depends_on)` \u2014 find task, remove from `depends_on` list, save\n3. `list_blocked_tasks(parent?)` \u2014 filter: status=OPEN, has depends_on, not all deps closed\n4. `reopen_task(task_id)` \u2014 find task, call `task.reopen()`, save\n5. `delete_task(task_id)` \u2014 remove task from list, save, return True\n6. `add_label(task_id, label)` \u2014 find task, call `task.add_label(label)`, save\n7. `remove_label(task_id, label)` \u2014 find task, call `task.remove_label(label)`, save\n8. Extend `update_task` to handle title, priority, notes field updates\n9. Update `get_task_counts` to include blocked count\n10. All mutations use existing atomic write pattern (temp file \u2192 rename)\n\n**Files:** src/cub/core/tasks/jsonl.py, tests/test_jsonl_backend.py",
