    "description": "The doctor command currently prints directly via Rich console. To support `--agent`, it needs to return structured diagnostic results instead. This is a refactor of the existing doctor command internals, not just adding a flag.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Define `DiagnosticResult` model (or use existing if one exists):\n2. Refactor doctor command to collect `list[DiagnosticResult]` before rendering\n3. Add `format_doctor(checks: list[DiagnosticResult])` to AgentFormatter:\n4. Add `--agent` flag to `cub doctor` command\n5. If agent: call `AgentFormatter.format_doctor(checks)`, print\n6. Ensure existing Rich output is unchanged when `--agent` is not passed\n7. Update `cub:doctor.md` skill to use `--agent`\n8. Write tests for both the refactored data collection and agent formatting\n\n**Files:** src/cub/cli/doctor.py, src/cub/core/services/agent_format.py, .claude/commands/cub:doctor.md, tests/test_agent_format.py",
