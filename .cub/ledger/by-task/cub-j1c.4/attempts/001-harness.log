I'll start by understanding the current state of the sync service and then implement the push and status operations.Let me search for existing sync-related files:Now let me read the current implementation files:Good! I can see the current state of the sync service. The `SyncStatus` enum already exists in `models.py`, which is great. Now I need to implement:

1. `push() -> bool` method - push the sync branch to remote
2. `get_status() -> SyncStatus` method - compare local and remote branch tips

Let me check what methods already exist and search for any references to these methods:Good, these methods don't exist yet. Now let me implement both methods in the SyncService class. Let me start:Now let me add the `push()` and `get_status()` methods at the end of the SyncService class:Great! Now I need to export the `SyncStatus` enum from the `__init__.py` file so it can be imported easily. Let me check the current exports:Now I need to write comprehensive tests for both methods. Let me add tests at the end of the test file:Now let me add comprehensive tests at the end of the file:Excellent! Now let me run the tests to make sure everything works correctly:Great! Now let's run the get_status tests:Perfect! All tests pass. Now let's run all sync service tests to ensure we didn't break anything:Excellent! All 75 tests pass. Now let's run type checking to ensure there are no type errors:The mypy error is in a different file (branches/store.py), not in the sync module. Let me run mypy specifically on the sync service files:This is a pre-existing issue. Let me check if our sync code has any type issues by using mypy's --no-error-summary flag and filtering:Perfect! No type errors in our sync code. Now let's run the linter:Great! Let's also run the linter on the test file:Perfect! All linting passes. Let's run a broader set of sync tests to ensure everything integrates well:Perfect! All 107 sync-related tests pass. Now let's close the task and commit our changes:Now let's commit the changes:Excellent! Now let me append learnings to progress.txt:Perfect! Let me verify the progress was appended:Perfect! Now let's commit the progress update:Excellent! Let me check if there are any remaining open tasks:Good! There are still open tasks. Let me check which tasks are ready to work on:Let me check the status of the cub-j1c epic to see if all its tasks are complete:Great! There's one more task in the cub-j1c epic (cub-j1c.5). Let me check if it's ready:Perfect! Task cub-j1c.5 is ready to work on. It's the final task in the cub-j1c epic. The task has been successfully completed!

## Summary

I have successfully completed task **cub-j1c.4: Implement push and status operations**. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation

1. **`push()` method** - Pushes the local sync branch to remote
   - Uses `git push --set-upstream` to automatically create remote branch if needed
   - Updates `SyncState` with push SHA and timestamp via `mark_pushed()`
   - Returns `bool` for simple success/failure indication
   - Handles failures gracefully by logging and returning `False`

2. **`get_status()` method** - Compares local and remote branches
   - Returns `SyncStatus` enum with 6 possible values:
     - `UNINITIALIZED` - sync branch doesn't exist
     - `NO_REMOTE` - remote branch doesn't exist or fetch failed
     - `UP_TO_DATE` - local and remote are identical
     - `AHEAD` - local has commits not pushed to remote
     - `BEHIND` - remote has commits not pulled locally
     - `DIVERGED` - branches have diverged
   - Uses `git merge-base` to determine branch relationship
   - Fetches remote branch and handles failures gracefully

3. **Added SyncStatus to public exports** in `__init__.py`

### Testing

- Added 13 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios:
  - Push: 6 tests (initialization, remote creation, state updates, failures, updates, working tree preservation)
  - Status: 7 tests (all 6 status values plus fetch failure handling)
- All **107 sync-related tests pass**
- Type checking is clean (no errors in sync code)
- Linting passes with no issues

### Quality Assurance

All feedback loops completed successfully:
- ✅ Type checking: No errors
- ✅ Tests: 107/107 passed
- ✅ Linting: All checks passed

The implementation follows established patterns from previous sync tasks and integrates seamlessly with the existing `SyncService` functionality.
