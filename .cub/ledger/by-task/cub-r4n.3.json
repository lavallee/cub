    "description": "The run loop needs to create a session on start, update it during execution, and end it on completion. This connects the session infrastructure to the actual execution flow.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Import RunSessionManager in `cli/run.py`\n2. At run start: instantiate manager, detect orphans, call `start_session()`\n3. After each task completes: call `update_session()`\n4. At run end: call `end_session()` with appropriate status\n5. Use try/finally to ensure session is ended even on exceptions\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/cli/run.py`",
