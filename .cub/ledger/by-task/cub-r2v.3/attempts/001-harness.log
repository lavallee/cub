I'll start by understanding the current task and searching the codebase to understand existing patterns.Now let me search for existing process management patterns in the codebase:Now let me check for existing tests to understand the testing patterns:Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me create the `process.py` module with proper process management utilities. Based on the patterns I found:

1. **Async-first design** using `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()`
2. **Process group handling** with `start_new_session=True` for Unix, Windows support
3. **Graceful shutdown** with escalating kill strategy
4. **Timeout support** using `asyncio.wait_for()`
5. **Platform detection** for Windows vs UnixGood! Now let me create comprehensive tests for the process module:Now let me run the feedback loops to validate the implementation:Good! Tests pass but there's a minor issue with the mock test. Let me fix that test:The test has a minor warning but it works. Let me simplify that test to avoid the async mock complexity:Actually, let me simplify even more - the test is getting complex. Let me just verify the behavior with a simpler approach:Good! Now let me run the tests again:Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me run type checking:Great! Now let me run linting:Let me fix the linting issue:Excellent! Now let me run the full test suite to make sure I haven't broken anything:Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me run the full typecheck to make sure everything is good:Excellent! Now let me close the task and commit the changes:Now let me commit the changes:Perfect! Now let me append the learnings to progress.txt. Let me check what exists:Now let me append my learnings:Perfect! Let me verify the task is closed and check if there are any more tasks:Great! The task is successfully closed. Let me check the next ready task:Let me check if these tests already exist:The tests already exist! Let me verify they're comprehensive:Perfect! The tests are comprehensive and already exist. Task cub-r2v.4 appears to have been completed already. Let me check the task status and see if I should close it:Perfect! The tests exist and all pass. According to my instructions, I should focus on ONE TASK only. Let me check if there are any other tasks in the current epic that need work:The only remaining task in this epic is cub-r2v.4, and as I discovered, the tests already exist and pass. My task (cub-r2v.3) is complete. Let me create a summary:

## Summary

I have successfully completed task **cub-r2v.3: Add process management utilities**.

### What Was Implemented

1. **Created `src/cub/core/tools/process.py`** (~330 lines)
   - `run_process()`: Async subprocess execution with timeout, env, cwd, and input support
   - `kill_process_group()`: Platform-aware process group termination (Unix/Windows)
   - `ensure_process_terminated()`: Graceful shutdown with escalating termination (SIGTERM → SIGKILL)
   - `wait_for_process()`: Timeout-aware process wait helper
   - `is_process_running()`: Simple status check
   - `ProcessResult`: Pydantic model for structured results
   - Platform detection constants (`IS_WINDOWS`, `IS_UNIX`)

2. **Created comprehensive test suite** (`tests/test_tools_process.py`, ~340 lines)
   - 23 tests covering all functionality
   - Real subprocess integration tests
   - Platform-specific test skipping
   - Mock-based edge case testing

### Key Features

- **Process groups on Unix** with `start_new_session=True` for clean multi-process termination
- **Escalating shutdown strategy**: Graceful SIGTERM → Wait → Force SIGKILL
- **Platform-aware**: Handles Windows/Unix differences appropriately
- **Timeout handling** with `asyncio.wait_for()` and proper cleanup
- **Structured results** with success/failure, exit codes, output, and timing
- **Environment merging** that preserves system env while adding custom vars

### Quality Metrics

✅ **All tests pass**: 396 total tests passing (1 skipped for platform)  
✅ **Type checking passes**: mypy clean on entire tools module (13 files)  
✅ **Linting passes**: ruff with no errors  
✅ **Committed** with detailed commit message and learnings documented in progress.txt  
✅ **Task closed** in beads system

The implementation follows all existing codebase patterns discovered through exploration and is ready for use by the CLI and MCP adapters.
