I'll start by claiming the task and understanding the codebase structure.Now I have a clear picture. The key file is `/home/lavallee/clawdbot/cub/src/cub/core/run/git_ops.py`. Let me read the relevant function.Now let me read the test file to understand the existing test patterns:Now I have a clear picture. I need to add upstream tracking after branch creation in `create_run_branch()`. After the `git checkout -b` succeeds, I'll configure the upstream with `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>` or use `git branch --set-upstream-to`. The best approach is `git config` to set the branch tracking info without actually pushing (since the remote branch may not exist yet). Let me use `git push -u origin <branch>` approach — but that would require network access. Better to use `git config` to set tracking locally.

Actually, the simplest and most robust approach: after creating the branch, configure tracking with `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch_name> <branch_name>` — but this requires the remote branch to exist. 

The best approach for an autonomous workflow is to configure the branch's push default so that `git push` works. We can set the branch's remote and merge config:

```
git config branch.<name>.remote origin
git config branch.<name>.merge refs/heads/<name>
```

This sets up tracking without requiring the remote branch to exist yet. When the user runs `git push`, git will know to push to `origin/<branch_name>`.

Let me implement this:Now add the `_configure_upstream_tracking` helper function before the other private functions:Now update the tests. The existing `test_create_new_branch_success` and `test_tries_remote_base_branch` tests need to account for the two extra `subprocess.run` calls:Now update `test_tries_remote_base_branch`:Now add a dedicated test for the upstream tracking configuration:Now let's run the tests and feedback loops:All 36 tests pass. Now let's run the broader feedback loops:The 2 failures are pre-existing environment-dependent failures in `test_harness_claude_sdk.py` (they fail because `CUB_RUN_ACTIVE` is already set in the environment). Not related to my changes.

Now run type checking and linting:All checks pass. Now close the task and commit:Now let me check if there are remaining open tasks:There are many remaining open tasks. The task `cub-n6x.4` is complete.

**Summary:** Added `_configure_upstream_tracking()` function to `git_ops.py` that runs `git config branch.<name>.remote origin` and `git config branch.<name>.merge refs/heads/<name>` after branch creation. This configures upstream tracking locally (without requiring the remote branch to exist yet), so `git push` works without `--set-upstream`. Added 2 new test cases and updated existing tests to verify the upstream tracking calls.
