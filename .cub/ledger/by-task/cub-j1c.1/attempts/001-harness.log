Now I have a clear understanding of the project. Let me read a few more files to understand the exact patterns I should follow:Now I have a complete understanding. Let me create the implementation. First, let me check if there are any existing git-related utilities or tests in the codebase:This is the dashboard sync integration test, not what I'm building. Now I have all the context I need. Let me create the SyncService implementation:Now let me run the quality gates to ensure the code passes:Now let me write tests for the SyncService:All 23 tests pass. Now let me run the full test suite and quality gates:These are pre-existing mypy errors related to missing type stubs, not my code. Let me verify my code passes by checking just the sync module again and then running ruff on the full codebase:The lint errors are pre-existing. Let me verify my new files are clean:My new code passes all checks. Now let me run the full test suite to make sure I haven't broken anything:Tests are running successfully. Let me check if they all pass:All 3544 tests pass (with 9 skipped and 12 warnings, which are pre-existing). Now let me close the task and commit:Now let me update progress.txt with learnings:Now let me check if there are more tasks to complete:The task is complete. Let me verify the task was closed:Task completed successfully. 

## Summary

I completed task `cub-j1c.1`: Create SyncService with git plumbing foundation.

**Files created:**
- `src/cub/core/sync/__init__.py` - Module exports
- `src/cub/core/sync/models.py` - SyncState, SyncStatus, SyncResult, SyncConflict Pydantic models
- `src/cub/core/sync/service.py` - SyncService class with git plumbing operations
- `tests/test_sync_service.py` - 23 comprehensive tests

**Key implementation details:**
1. `SyncService` class with configurable `project_dir`, `branch_name`, and `tasks_file`
2. `_run_git(args)` helper using subprocess with 60s timeout and proper error handling
3. `is_initialized()` using `git show-ref --verify` to check if branch exists
4. `initialize()` creates sync branch from HEAD (if commits exist) or empty tree (for new repos)
5. `SyncState` Pydantic model for persisting sync state to `.cub/.sync-state.json`

**Quality gates passed:**
- ✅ mypy (sync module only - pre-existing issues in other files)
- ✅ ruff lint
- ✅ ruff format
- ✅ pytest (all 23 new tests + 3544 existing tests pass)The task has already been completed. The background task notification is just confirming what I already retrieved - the test suite passed successfully (3544 passed, 9 skipped, 12 warnings).

The task `cub-j1c.1` has been:
1. ✅ Implemented - Created SyncService with git plumbing foundation
2. ✅ Tested - 23 new tests all passing
3. ✅ Quality gates passed - mypy, ruff lint, ruff format
4. ✅ Closed via `bd close cub-j1c.1`
5. ✅ Committed - `task(cub-j1c.1): Create SyncService with git plumbing foundation`
6. ✅ Learnings appended to progress.txt

The task is complete. Is there another task you'd like me to work on?
