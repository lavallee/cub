    "description": "Add `--agent` flag to `cub task blocked`, `cub task list`, and `cub ledger show`. These commands should already exist from the task parity spec. Wire in the AgentFormatter methods.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. In `cub task blocked` (cli/task.py):\n2. In `cub task list` (cli/task.py):\n3. In `cub ledger show` (cli/ledger.py):\n4. Update corresponding skill files to use `--agent`\n5. Write CLI tests\n\n**Files:** src/cub/cli/task.py, src/cub/cli/ledger.py, .claude/commands/cub:tasks.md, .claude/commands/cub:ledger.md",
