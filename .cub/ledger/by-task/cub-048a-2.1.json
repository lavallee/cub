    "description": "The `--plan` flag enables `cub run` to execute an entire plan by iterating through its epics. This replaces the separate `build-plan` command with integrated functionality.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Add `plan: str | None` field to `RunConfig` model\n2. Add `--plan` flag to `cub run` CLI command\n3. Extract plan iteration logic from `build_plan.py`\n4. Add `execute_plan(plan_slug: str)` method to `RunLoop` or `RunService`\n5. Implement epic ordering and iteration\n6. Handle epic completion detection (all tasks in epic done)\n7. Support `--start-epic` and `--only-epic` options for partial runs\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/run/models.py`, `src/cub/core/run/loop.py`, `src/cub/cli/run.py`",

    "approach": "The implementation added plan execution capability to `cub run` by extending the RunConfig model with plan-related fields, adding corresponding CLI flags with validation, and implementing a comprehensive `_run_plan()` function that iterates through epics, detects completion, creates ledger entries, and supports partial execution via --start-epic and --only-epic flags.",
