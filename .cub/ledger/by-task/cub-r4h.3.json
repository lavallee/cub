    "description": "Based on audit findings, fix any exit paths that don't preserve artifacts. This is the core deliverable of E4.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Review gaps identified in cub-r4h.1 audit\n2. Add try/finally blocks where needed to ensure `write_run_artifact()` is called\n3. Ensure `StatusWriter.write()` is called before any exit\n4. Handle edge cases: exceptions during artifact write, partial state\n5. Run integration tests to verify fixes\n\n**Files:** src/cub/cli/run.py, src/cub/core/status/writer.py",
