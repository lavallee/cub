    "description": "The hook executor runs user scripts with context passed via environment variables. Discovery finds scripts in project and global hook directories.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Create `src/cub/core/hooks/discovery.py`\n2. Implement `discover_hooks(hook_name: str) -> list[Path]`\n3. Create `src/cub/core/hooks/executor.py`\n4. Implement `HookExecutor.run(hook_name: str, context: BaseModel) -> HookResult`\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/hooks/discovery.py`, `src/cub/core/hooks/executor.py`",
