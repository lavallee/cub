    "description": "The Kanban dashboard currently displays a column titled \"SPECS\" for spec entities in the researching/ directory. This should be renamed to \"RESEARCHING\" to better reflect the workflow stage and align with the actual spec status value.\n\n**Context:**\nThe dashboard's 8-column workflow includes a stage for specs that are actively being researched. The column header \"SPECS\" is ambiguous\u2014it refers to the entity type rather than the workflow stage.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Column header displays \"RESEARCHING\" instead of \"SPECS\"\n- Contains spec entities with status \"researching\"\n- Maintains all filtering and grouping logic\n- API response structure unchanged (still maps to SPECS stage internally if needed)",
