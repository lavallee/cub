    "description": "In the dashboard ready column, tasks should be grouped by their associated epic. Tasks without an epic should appear in a separate ungrouped section.\n\n**Context:**\nThe dashboard currently displays ready tasks without epic grouping. Tasks can be associated with epics through multiple mechanisms:\n1. Parent relationship (beads parent field)\n2. Label with epic ID format (e.g., `epic:cub-abc`)\n3. Explicit epic_id field in task metadata\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Sync layer detects epic associations during task parsing (check parent, labels, epic_id)\n- [ ] Task model stores epic_id field after sync\n- [ ] Ready column displays tasks grouped by epic\n- [ ] Tasks without epic association appear in separate \"No Epic\" group\n- [ ] Epic names/titles appear as group headers\n- [ ] Dashboard API returns epic grouping metadata in `/api/board` response",
