    "description": "The relationship resolver links entities via explicit markers and computes the correct stage for each entity based on multiple signals.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Create `src/cub/core/dashboard/sync/resolver.py`\n2. Implement `RelationshipResolver` class:\n3. Implement `compute_stage()` function following architecture logic:\n4. Enrich entities with ledger data (cost, tokens, etc.)\n5. Add comprehensive tests for stage computation edge cases\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/dashboard/sync/resolver.py`, `tests/test_resolver.py`",
