    "description": "The generator creates new IDs by combining counter allocation with the ID models. It provides the primary API for creating new specs, plans, epics, and tasks.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Create `src/cub/core/ids/generator.py`\n2. Implement `generate_spec_id(project: str, sync_service: SyncService) -> SpecId`\n3. Implement `generate_plan_id(spec: SpecId, letter: str) -> PlanId` (letter is explicit)\n4. Implement `generate_epic_id(plan: PlanId, char: str) -> EpicId` (char is explicit)\n5. Implement `generate_task_id(epic: EpicId, number: int) -> TaskId` (number is explicit)\n6. Implement `generate_standalone_id(project: str, sync_service: SyncService) -> StandaloneTaskId`\n7. Add helper `next_plan_letter(existing: list[str]) -> str` for auto-selection\n8. Add helper `next_epic_char(existing: list[str]) -> str` for auto-selection\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/ids/generator.py`",

This provides flexibility while enforcing intentional ID choices at hierarchy levels.",
