    "description": "The pre-push hook verifies that locally-used spec/standalone numbers don't conflict with the remote sync branch. This catches collisions before they're pushed. The hook is installed by `cub init`.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Create `src/cub/core/ids/hooks.py` with hook logic\n2. Implement `verify_counters_before_push() -> tuple[bool, str]` that:\n3. Create shell script template `templates/hooks/pre-push` that calls Python\n4. Update `cub init` to install pre-push hook to `.git/hooks/pre-push`\n5. Make hook skip gracefully if sync branch not initialized\n6. Add `--no-verify` documentation for bypassing\n\n**Files:** `src/cub/core/ids/hooks.py`, `templates/hooks/pre-push`, `src/cub/cli/init_cmd.py`",
