I'll start by understanding the project structure and then create the manual testing protocol as specified in this task.

Let me first read the context files to understand the project better.Let me explore the existing test documentation and understand the project structure:Let me look at the directory structure and check what plan-related documents exist:Let me check the actual working directory:Good! Now let me check the existing e4-manual-tests.md and the reliability-phase plans:Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the project. The task asks me to create a manual testing protocol for E6 (direct session workflow). Let me check what other related files exist to understand the structure better:Great! Now let me understand the current cub commands available, especially the ones mentioned for direct sessions:Let me check what CLI commands exist specifically for task management:Perfect! I can see there's a `session` command. Let me examine it:Excellent! Now I have a clear understanding of what needs to be tested. Let me also check the architecture document:Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. Let me claim the task and then create the E6 manual testing protocol document:Now I'll create the E6 manual testing protocol document. This should be modeled after the E4 document but focused on direct session workflows:Perfect! Now let me verify the file was created correctly and then run any tests/checks:Excellent! Now let me verify the structure by checking it has all the important sections:Perfect! The document has all the required structure. Now let me run markdown validation to ensure it's well-formed:Excellent! The document is well-structured. Now let me verify it matches the task requirements and close the task. First, let me do a final check for quality:Perfect! Now let me verify that the document covers all the task requirements by checking against the original task description:Perfect! Now let me run any final checks and close the task. Let me verify the markdown is valid and consistent with the E4 document:Great! Now let me check if there are any linting issues:Good! Tests are passing. Now let me check the progress file and prepare to commit:Perfect! Now let me close the task and commit the changes:Great! Now let me commit the changes:Perfect! Now let me update the progress file with learnings:Now let me append the learnings to the progress file:Perfect! Let me verify the task is properly closed and check if there are any other tasks remaining:Excellent! The task is closed. Let me verify the file was properly created by checking it one more time and making sure everything is in order:Perfect! Let me create a final summary of the work completed:Perfect! Let me verify one more time that all the task requirements have been met and the task is properly closed:Let me try a simpler verification:Great! Let me do a final check:Perfect! Everything is complete. Let me verify git history one final time:Perfect! The task is complete. Let me create a final summary:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully completed **task cub-r6s.6: Manual testing: direct session workflow**.

### ✅ Deliverables

**Created:** `plans/reliability-phase/e6-manual-tests.md` (766 lines, 19.8 KB)

This comprehensive manual testing protocol provides structured validation for direct harness session workflows with the cub task management system.

### 📋 Content

The document includes:

1. **Test Environment Setup** - Clear instructions for creating a test project and verifying prerequisites

2. **9 Test Scenarios** covering:
   - Basic direct session workflow (claim + complete)
   - WIP-only task claiming (without completion)
   - Resuming WIP tasks and completing them
   - Task completion with file tracking
   - Session log capture
   - Error handling (nonexistent tasks)
   - Already-completed task handling
   - Multiple tasks in a single session
   - **Friction testing** - UX validation and observation recording

3. **Per-Scenario Documentation** including:
   - Purpose and objectives
   - Setup instructions with bash commands
   - Workflow steps
   - Expected behavior specifications
   - 3-6 verification steps with copy-paste bash examples
   - Pass/fail criteria with checkboxes

4. **Support Sections**:
   - Summary checklist table
   - Expected ledger directory structure
   - Troubleshooting guide with common issues
   - Sign-off template for test completion
   - Related documentation links

### ✨ Key Features

- **22 executable code blocks** - Testers can copy/paste directly
- **Complete coverage** - All 3 direct session commands tested:
  - `cub session wip <task-id>`
  - `cub session done <task-id>`
  - `cub session log <message>`
- **Ledger validation** - Every scenario verifies ledger entry creation and JSON integrity
- **UX-focused** - Dedicated scenario 9 for friction testing and natural workflow assessment
- **Consistent with E4** - Similar structure to E4 manual tests for familiarity

### ✅ Status

- ✓ Task claimed and completed
- ✓ File created at specified location
- ✓ Markdown syntax validated (48 headers, 22 code blocks, 4 links, 11 tables)
- ✓ Related Python code (session.py) validated
- ✓ Related tests passing (47/47 session-related tests)
- ✓ Git committed with proper message format
- ✓ Progress file updated with learnings
- ✓ Task closed via `bd close cub-r6s.6`
