I'll start by understanding the current task and then implement the required changes. Let me first claim the task and explore the files that need to be updated.Good! Now let me find the correct working directory and claim the task:Perfect! Now let me claim the task:Great! Now let me read the files that need to be updated. I'll start by reading each one to understand their current structure:Perfect! I can see the files clearly now. I need to add `--agent` flags to the CLI command invocations. Let me analyze what needs to be changed:

1. **cub:tasks.md** - Line 20: Add `--agent` to the blocked tasks command
2. **cub:status.md** - No changes needed (doesn't use CLI commands that need output)
3. **cub:suggest.md** - No changes needed (doesn't use CLI commands)
4. **cub:ledger.md** - No changes needed (doesn't use CLI commands with output parsing)
5. **cub:doctor.md** - No changes needed (doesn't use CLI commands with output parsing)
6. **cub.md** - Multiple commands need `--agent` flags

Let me start making the updates:Good! Now let me update the status.md file to add `--agent`:Now let me update suggest.md:Now let me update ledger.md:Now let me update doctor.md:Now let me update the main router file (cub.md). This has multiple commands that need updating:Now let me update the task routing table in cub.md:Now let me update the Project Status & History section in cub.md:Now let me update the Project Health & Maintenance section:Now let me update the Execution rules section to add instruction about `--agent` output:Great! Now let me verify all changes have been made correctly by reviewing each file:Perfect! Now let me verify the router skill (cub.md) has all the necessary `--agent` flags:Excellent! All the changes have been made. Now let me run any feedback loops to ensure nothing is broken. Let me check if there are any tests or linting in this project:Let me check if there's a pytest configuration and run the tests:Good! The tests are running. Let me run them all and check for any failures related to my changes:Let me wait for the tests to complete:Perfect! All tests passed! Now let me verify the changes one more time and then close the task:Perfect! Now let me create a summary of all the changes made:Now let me close the task using the beads CLI:Excellent! Now let me commit the changes:Perfect! The task is complete. Let me verify the final state:Perfect! The task is successfully completed. Let me verify there are no other open tasks in the epic that I should work on:Let me check for remaining open tasks differently:Perfect! The epic itself (cub-a2s) is still open, which is expected since it's just a container for tasks. Let me check if there are any other open tasks in the epic:Excellent! There are no other open tasks in the cub-a2s epic. The task cub-a2s.1 has been successfully completed. Let me verify the final state of the files one more time:Perfect! The task has been successfully completed. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

**Task ID:** cub-a2s.1  
**Title:** Update passthrough skills and router to use --agent

### Changes Made

I successfully updated all seven passthrough skills and the router skill to include the `--agent` flag on all CLI command invocations:

1. **`.claude/commands/cub:tasks.md`** - Added `--agent` to all 6 task subcommands:
   - `cub task ready --agent`
   - `cub task show <id> --full --agent`
   - `cub task list --status open --agent`
   - `cub task claim <id> --agent`
   - `cub task close <id> -r "<reason>" --agent`
   - `cub task list --status blocked --agent`

2. **`.claude/commands/cub:status.md`** - Added `--agent` to all 3 status commands

3. **`.claude/commands/cub:suggest.md`** - Added `--agent` to suggest command

4. **`.claude/commands/cub:ledger.md`** - Added `--agent` to all 3 ledger commands

5. **`.claude/commands/cub:doctor.md`** - Added `--agent` to doctor command

6. **`.claude/commands/cub.md`** (router) - Added `--agent` to all CLI command mappings across all sections:
   - Task Discovery & Management
   - Project Status & History
   - Project Health & Maintenance
   - Default suggestions

7. **`.claude/commands/cub.md`** - Added documentation in the Execution Rules section explaining:
   - All commands include `--agent` flag to receive structured output
   - Claude treats structured output as the source of truth for better context and follow-up actions

### Validation

✅ All 5006 tests passed successfully  
✅ Task closed successfully  
✅ Changes committed with proper formatting

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>I appreciate the confirmations! The system confirms that all the file modifications were intentional and as expected. All the changes have been successfully implemented and committed.

To summarize the completed task:

## ✅ Task cub-a2s.1 Complete

**What was done:**
- Updated 7 passthrough skill files to include `--agent` flag on CLI invocations
- Updated the router skill (cub.md) to route all commands with `--agent` flag
- Added documentation in the router's Execution Rules explaining how Claude should treat `--agent` structured output

**Files modified:**
1. `.claude/commands/cub:tasks.md` ✅
2. `.claude/commands/cub:status.md` ✅
3. `.claude/commands/cub:suggest.md` ✅
4. `.claude/commands/cub:ledger.md` ✅
5. `.claude/commands/cub:doctor.md` ✅
6. `.claude/commands/cub.md` (router) ✅

**Validation:**
- ✅ All 5006 tests passed
- ✅ Task closed successfully in beads
- ✅ Changes committed with proper message format

The implementation ensures that whenever Claude routes through the cub skills, all CLI commands include the `--agent` flag to receive structured output, enabling better context-aware responses and follow-up actions.
