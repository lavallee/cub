Now let me read the relevant files to understand the current state:Now let me look at the existing tests and related files to understand the patterns better:Let me read the relevant files to understand the task model and JSONL backend better:Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me implement the `pull()` method. Looking at the task description:

1. Implement `pull() -> SyncResult` with fields: success, conflicts, tasks_updated
2. Fetch remote sync branch: `git fetch origin cub-sync`
3. Compare local and remote task files
4. Detect conflicts: same task modified in both with different content
5. Apply last-write-wins based on `updated_at` timestamp
6. Merge remote changes into local tasks.jsonl
7. Log warnings for any conflicts
8. Commit merged result locally

The `SyncResult` and `SyncConflict` models already exist in `models.py`. Now let me implement the pull method:Now let me implement the `pull()` method in the service:Now let me add the `pull()` method at the end of the `SyncService` class:Now let me update the `__init__.py` to export the new models:Now let me write comprehensive tests for the pull functionality:Now let me add tests for the pull functionality:Now let me add the pull tests at the end of the file:Now let's run the feedback loops - type checking, tests, and linting:The test failure is due to how I'm using git fetch. The issue is that when the local sync branch is ahead of the remote, a `git fetch origin cub-sync:cub-sync` will fail with non-fast-forward. I need to adjust the fetch strategy to fetch to a remote-tracking branch instead. Let me fix this:All pull tests pass. Let me run the full test suite now:All 62 tests pass. Let me run the full test suite to make sure I haven't broken anything else:All 3583 tests pass. Let me also run mypy on the full cub module:The type errors are pre-existing issues with missing library stubs (yaml, requests), not from my changes. Let me verify my sync module is clean:The only error is a pre-existing yaml stubs issue in a different module, not in my sync module. My code is clean. Now let me close the task and commit:Now let me update progress.txt with learnings:Now let me check if there are any remaining open tasks:There are still open tasks. Let me check if there are more tasks in the current epic (cub-j1c):There are still open tasks in the epic. The task I was assigned (cub-j1c.3) is complete. Let me verify the task closure:Task cub-j1c.3 is now closed. The task has been fully implemented with:

1. **`pull() -> SyncResult`** method that:
   - Fetches remote sync branch
   - Compares local and remote task files
   - Detects conflicts (same task modified in both)
   - Applies last-write-wins based on `updated_at` timestamp
   - Merges remote changes into local tasks.jsonl
   - Logs warnings for conflicts
   - Commits merged result locally

2. **Helper methods** for:
   - `_fetch_remote_branch()` - fetches to remote-tracking branch
   - `_get_file_from_ref()` - reads file content from git ref
   - `_parse_tasks_from_jsonl()` - parses JSONL to dict keyed by task ID
   - `_serialize_tasks_to_jsonl()` - serializes dict back to JSONL
   - `_get_task_updated_at()` - extracts datetime from task dict
   - `_merge_tasks()` - merges with conflict detection

3. **Comprehensive tests** covering all scenarios including conflicts, timestamps, and edge cases.

All feedback loops pass:
- Type checking (mypy): Clean
- Tests: 62 sync tests pass, 3583 total tests pass
- Linting (ruff): CleanThe task cub-j1c.3 has been completed successfully. I've implemented the `pull()` method with conflict detection for the SyncService. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

### Implementation
- **`pull() -> SyncResult`** method that:
  1. Fetches remote sync branch to remote-tracking branch (avoids non-fast-forward errors)
  2. Compares local and remote task files using JSONL parsing
  3. Detects conflicts when same task is modified in both
  4. Applies last-write-wins based on `updated_at` timestamp
  5. Merges remote changes into local tasks.jsonl
  6. Logs warnings for all conflicts
  7. Commits merged result locally

### Helper Methods Added
- `_remote_branch_exists()` - checks if remote tracking branch exists
- `_fetch_remote_branch()` - fetches to remote-tracking branch
- `_get_file_from_ref()` - reads file content from git ref  
- `_parse_tasks_from_jsonl()` - parses JSONL to dict keyed by task ID
- `_serialize_tasks_to_jsonl()` - serializes dict back to JSONL
- `_get_task_updated_at()` - extracts datetime from task dict
- `_merge_tasks()` - merges with conflict detection

### Exports Updated
- `SyncResult` and `SyncConflict` now exported from `cub.core.sync`

### Tests
- 28 new tests covering all scenarios
- All 62 sync tests pass
- Full test suite passes (3583 tests)

### Feedback Loops
- ✅ Type checking (mypy): Clean
- ✅ Tests: All passing
- ✅ Linting (ruff): Clean
