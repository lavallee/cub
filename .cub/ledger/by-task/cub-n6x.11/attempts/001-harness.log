I'll start by claiming the task and exploring the codebase to understand the punchlist processing flow.Now let me read the key files:Now I have a clear picture. Looking at the code, I can see that the `on_start` and `on_complete` callbacks already exist and are already wired up in `punchlist.py` (lines 149-160). The current implementation uses `console.print()` which outputs line-by-line text. 

The task asks to replace this with Rich progress tracking. Let me check what Rich progress utilities are used elsewhere and look at the tests:Let me check how toolsmith uses Progress for a pattern to follow:Now I have a clear understanding. The current code already has `on_start`/`on_complete` callbacks that print progress, but it uses plain `console.print()`. The task asks to replace this with Rich Progress tracking for better UX.

Let me implement the changes. The key change is in `punchlist.py` - replacing the plain print callbacks with a Rich Progress bar that shows `[N/TOTAL]` format with item titles:Now replace the hydration section with Rich Progress:Now let me run the feedback loops:All checks pass. Let me also verify mypy completed (it seemed to have empty output):All checks pass. Now close the task and commit:Let me check if all tasks are closed:There are many other open tasks. Let me check if there are remaining tasks in my specific epic:All children of this epic are closed. The task is complete.
