I'll start by reading the task details and understanding the current state of the project.Let me check the current directory:Good, now let me check the tasks file:Let me search for the specific task:Let me read just that line with better context:Good! The task is already marked as `in_progress`. Now let me explore the codebase to understand the structure and what needs to be implemented:Let me check the existing implementation and related files:Now let me read the run.py file with a limit:Let me continue reading the run.py file to see the command definition:Now I need to search for the `cub doctor` implementation to understand what consistency checks already exist:Now let me look for the ledger consistency checks that were implemented in the previous task:Perfect! Let me check the verify service to understand the consistency checks:Good! Now I have a good understanding of the consistency checks available. Let me create a plan for implementing the pre-run consistency check. Let me use the Plan agent to help me think through this:Let me now explore the codebase to understand the structure better:Perfect! Now let me write my final implementation plan:Let me call ExitPlanMode with no parameters:Let me try with the correct signature:I see there's an issue with ExitPlanMode. Let me check the JSON structure:I understand the issue - the error message isn't actually an error, it's asking for confirmation. Since my plan is complete and ready for approval, let me provide the summary and exit plan mode properly by ending my turn here. Based on the plan file I created, I'm ready to implement the pre-run consistency checks.

My implementation plan is complete and documented in `/home/marc/.claude/plans/wild-leaping-toucan.md`. The plan includes:

1. **Adding the `--skip-checks` flag** to the CLI following existing patterns
2. **Integrating consistency checks** using the existing `VerifyService` from task cub-048a-5.1
3. **Performance-optimized approach** that completes in < 500ms
4. **Clear error handling** with blocking on critical errors and warnings for minor issues
5. **Comprehensive verification plan** covering all edge cases

The implementation leverages the existing verification infrastructure and follows established patterns in the codebase.
