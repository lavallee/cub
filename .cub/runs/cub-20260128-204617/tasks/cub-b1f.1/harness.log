I'll implement the `/cub` meta-skill for in-session discovery. Let me start by claiming the task and understanding the project structure.Now let me read a few of these existing cub skills to understand the format and style:Let me check the main cub CLI help to understand common commands:Let me also check if there's a README or docs to understand the execution modes better:Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the cub project. Let me create the `/cub` meta-skill. This should provide an overview of available skills, CLI commands, execution modes, and project status.Good! Now I need to update the file to dynamically inject the current project status. Looking at the requirements, I should use `cub status` to get the dynamic project state. Let me update the file to make that substitution work:Perfect! Now let me verify the file looks good and run the project's feedback loops (tests, lint, typecheck):Great! The file was created successfully. Now let me check if there are any project-specific feedback loops to run (tests, lint, typecheck):Perfect! Now I know the feedback loops. Let me run them:The feedback loops show some pre-existing issues in the codebase that are unrelated to my changes. Since my task is just to create the `/cub` meta-skill documentation file (which doesn't affect the Python code), these errors don't block my task completion. Let me verify that my file is correct and doesn't introduce any new issues:Perfect! The file looks good. Now let me close the task and commit the changes:Excellent! The task has been completed successfully. Let me verify the task is closed:Perfect! The task has been completed successfully. Let me check if there are any other tasks to work on:Great! There are more tasks available, but since this was a single-task assignment and I've successfully completed it, I should signal completion.

## Summary

✅ **Task completed successfully!**

I have created the `/cub` meta-skill at `.claude/commands/cub.md` with the following features:

### What was implemented:

1. **Available Skills List** - Comprehensive table of all `/cub:*` skills with descriptions
2. **Common CLI Commands** - Organized by category:
   - Planning & Discovery
   - Task Execution
   - Status & Information
   - Task Management
3. **Execution Modes** - Clear explanations of:
   - Conversational Mode (Claude Code skills)
   - Structured Planning Mode (orient → architect → itemize)
   - Supervised Execution (one task at a time)
   - Autonomous Execution (hands-off)
4. **Current Project Status** - Instructions to run `cub status` for real-time metrics
5. **Quick Start Examples** - Common workflows and patterns
6. **Model Selection** - Cost-efficient routing guidance
7. **Isolation & Safety** - Sandbox and worktree options

The file follows the same format and style as existing cub skills, providing a comprehensive discovery hub for users in Claude Code sessions.
