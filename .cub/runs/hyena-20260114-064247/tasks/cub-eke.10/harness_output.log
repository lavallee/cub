The modifications to `lib/cmd_init.sh` are already accounted for and are part of my implementation for cub-eke.10, so everything is in good order.\n\nThe task is complete! Here's what was accomplished:\n\n## Summary: Task cub-eke.10 - .cub/README.md Generation\n\n### ✅ Implementation Complete\n\n**Files Created/Modified:**\n- ✨ `templates/README.md` - New template with quick reference guide\n- 🔧 `lib/cmd_init.sh` - Added README.md generation logic and updated help text\n\n**Features:**\n- **Quick reference table** showing file purposes (editable vs reference)\n- **Essential cub/beads commands** for task management\n- **Guidance on editing** each .cub file with specific use cases\n- **Tips for AI assistants** working on projects\n- **Contextual HTML comments** explaining purpose and edit guidelines (following cub-eke.9 pattern)\n\n**Testing:**\n- ✅ CLI tests pass\n- ✅ Cub tests pass  \n- ✅ E2E tests pass\n- ✅ Manual verification of README generation works correctly\n\n**Commits:**\n- `b85a42a` - task(cub-eke.10): .cub/README.md generation\n- `5b17f20` - task(cub-eke.10): Mark task closed in beads\n\nThe generated README.md is now automatically created in `.cub/` during project initialization with `cub init`, serving as an in-project quick reference for developers and AI assistants.","session_id":"1280b0f3-9872-4c04-b5cb-6f5242fd5c50","total_cost_usd":0.5831062000000001,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1486,"cache_read_input_tokens":66165,"output_tokens":395,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1486}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":62397,"outputTokens":15597,"cacheReadInputTokens":3111367,"cacheCreationInputTokens":105270,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.5831062000000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"272e0cb7-47c8-437f-b75e-32365278d284"}
