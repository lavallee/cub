I'll help you remove all progress.txt references from templates and prompts. Let me start by claiming the task and then searching for all occurrences.Interesting! The grep searches returned no results. Let me do a broader search to understand the current state:Great! I found that `templates/progress.txt` exists. Let me read the key files to understand what needs to be changed:Perfect! I can see that:
1. `templates/PROMPT.md` no longer has any explicit references to `progress.txt` or `@progress.txt`
2. There's a `templates/progress.txt` file that exists but appears to be a template

Let me check if there are any references in the Python code:Good! I can see that `src/cub/core/instructions.py` doesn't reference `progress.txt` at all. Now let me search more broadly to ensure there are no other references:The results show that `progress.txt` is referenced in many places, particularly:
1. Documentation files
2. Ledger files (historical prompts)
3. Test files
4. The template file itself (`templates/progress.txt`)

Let me focus on the files mentioned in the task description and check for any code that actively generates or uses progress.txt:Good! There are no `progress.txt` references in the CLI code. Now let me check if there's any code that copies or generates the progress.txt template file:Perfect! Now let me check the init command to see if it generates progress.txt:Excellent! Now let me do a comprehensive check to see if the template file is actually used anywhere:Perfect! Now let's verify the current state of the key files and understand what needs to be removed. Based on my search:

1. `templates/PROMPT.md` - Already clean, no references to `@progress.txt`
2. `src/cub/core/instructions.py` - Already clean, no references
3. `src/cub/cli/run.py` - Already clean, no references
4. `templates/progress.txt` - This template file exists but is not being used

Let me verify the final state and remove the template file:Perfect! The only thing left is to remove the template file itself since it's no longer being used:Excellent! The file has been successfully removed. Now let me run a comprehensive verification to ensure there are no remaining references:Perfect! Now let me run the feedback loops (tests, typecheck, lint) as required before closing the task:Perfect! Now let's run the feedback loops (tests, typecheck, lint) to ensure everything still works:Tests are running successfully! Let me wait for them to complete and then run the type checker and linter:Good! Only 2 test failures that are unrelated to my changes. Let me check what the test_cleanup.py failure is about since it might be related to the cleanup configuration:Excellent! This is exactly related to my task! The test is expecting `progress.txt` to be in the cleanup configuration's artifact patterns. I need to remove that expectation from the test and also remove it from the cleanup config itself. Let me check both:Great! I found the test that needs to be updated. The cleanup config itself seems to have already been updated (no matches found in src/cub/). Let me update the test to remove the progress.txt assertion:Perfect! Now let's re-run the test to verify it passes:Excellent! The test now passes. Let me run the type checker and linter to ensure everything is still good:Good! These are pre-existing type errors unrelated to my changes. Now let's run the linter:These are also pre-existing linting issues unrelated to my changes. Let me now verify once more that all progress.txt references have been removed from the key areas:Perfect! All progress.txt references have been removed from the key files. Let me also verify that the template file itself is gone:Excellent! Now let me close the task and commit the changes:Perfect! Let me check if there are any other tasks in the backlog:Great! There are many more tasks. Let me check what the next task in the epic is:Perfect! There are two more tasks in the cub-r1a epic. Since my task (cub-r1a.1) is complete and there are more tasks to do, the workflow is NOT complete yet. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Complete ✓

I've successfully completed task **cub-r1a.1: Remove progress.txt references from templates and prompts**.

### What was done:

1. **Removed the unused template file**: Deleted `templates/progress.txt` which was no longer being referenced or used by the codebase
   
2. **Updated test file**: Removed the assertion in `tests/test_cleanup.py` that was checking for `progress.txt` in the cleanup configuration's artifact patterns

3. **Verified no active references**: Confirmed that:
   - `templates/PROMPT.md` - Already clean (no `@progress.txt` or progress.txt references)
   - `src/cub/core/instructions.py` - Already clean (no progress.txt references)
   - `src/cub/cli/run.py` - Already clean (no progress.txt references)
   - No Python code was actively generating or copying progress.txt files

4. **All tests passing**: The previously failing test (`test_cleanup.py::TestCleanupConfig::test_default_config`) now passes. Only 1 unrelated test failure remains in `test_tools_execution.py`.

5. **Committed changes**: Created a git commit with conventional format: `task(cub-r1a.1): Remove progress.txt references from templates and prompts`

### Key finding:
The progress.txt sprawl issue had already been largely addressed in previous work - the template references were already removed from `PROMPT.md` and the code wasn't actively generating these files. This task cleaned up the remaining artifacts (the unused template file and outdated test assertion).
