Code is merged to main locally, not pushed.\n\n## Core Rules\n- Track strategic work in beads (multi-session, dependencies, discovered work)\n- Use `bd create` for issues, TodoWrite for simple single-session execution\n- When in doubt, prefer bd—persistence you don't need beats lost context\n- Git workflow: run `bd sync --from-main` at session end\n- Session management: check `bd ready` for available work\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n### Finding Work\n- `bd ready` - Show issues ready to work (no blockers)\n- `bd list --status=open` - All open issues\n- `bd list --status=in_progress` - Your active work\n- `bd show <id>` - Detailed issue view with dependencies\n\n### Creating & Updating\n- `bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task|bug|feature --priority=2` - New issue\n  - Priority: 0-4 or P0-P4 (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog).

Valid symlinks (passing checks)\n   158→     - Broken symlinks (pointing to wrong target)\n   159→     - Regular files instead of symlinks\n   160→     - Missing symlinks (optional warnings)\n   161→   - Uses `readlink` to verify symlink targets\n   162→\n   163→2. **.gitignore Validation (`_doctor_check_gitignore`)**\n   164→   - Validates .gitignore exists\n   165→   - Checks for required patterns:\n   166→     - `.cub/runs` - Session run artifacts\n   167→     - `.bv/` - Beads viewer cache\n   168→   - Detects missing patterns and reports them\n   169→   - Uses grep with `^` anchor to ensure patterns are at line start\n   170→\n   171→3. **Integration into cub doctor**\n   172→   - Both validations integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`\n   173→   - Outputs clear [OK] and [!!] status indicators\n   174→   - Non-blocking warnings (project can work without perfect symlinks/gitignore)\n   175→\n   176→### Testing\n   177→\n   178→- Added 8 new tests to tests/doctor.bats\n   179→- All 40 tests passing in doctor.bats\n   180→- Tests cover:\n   181→  - Valid symlinks (single and multiple)\n   182→  - Broken/incorrect symlinks\n   183→  - Regular files instead of symlinks\n   184→  - Missing .gitignore\n   185→  - Missing patterns in .gitignore\n   186→  - Complete .gitignore validation\n   187→  - Edge cases (leading whitespace in patterns)\n   188→\n   189→### Implementation Details\n   190→\n   191→**Symlink Validation:**\n   192→1. Only runs for new layout (`_PROJECT_LAYOUT == \"new\"`)\n   193→2. Uses bash `-L` test to check if path is symlink\n   194→3. Uses `readlink` to get actual target\n   195→4. String comparison of targets (avoiding path resolution complexity)\n   196→\n   197→**Gitignore Validation:**\n   198→1. Checks for file existence first\n   199→2. Uses `grep -q \"^${pattern}\"` for exact line matching\n   200→3. Accumulates missing patterns in array\n   201→4. Provides detailed report of what's missing\n   202→\n   203→### How to Use\n   204→\n   205→```bash\n   206→# Run standard diagnostics including structure validation\n   207→cub doctor\n   208→\n   209→# Show detailed information\n   210→cub doctor --verbose\n   211→\n   212→# View what would be fixed (currently informational only)\n   213→cub doctor --dry-run\n   214→\n   215→# Check specific validations by examining output\n   216→cub doctor | grep -A 10 \"Project Structure\"\n   217→```\n   218→\n   219→### Future Enhancements\n   220→\n   221→The implementation provides foundation for:\n   222→1. Auto-fix of broken symlinks (--fix flag)\n   223→2. Auto-generation of missing symlinks\n   224→3. Auto-addition of missing .gitignore patterns\n   225→4. Validation of symlink targets existence\n   226→5. .gitignore comment/whitespace handling improvements\n   227→\n   228→### Files Modified\n   229→- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added `_doctor_check_symlinks()` and `_doctor_check_gitignore()` functions, integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`\n   230→- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 8 comprehensive tests for new validation functions\n   231→\n   232→### Commit\n   233→e17d239 task(cub-eke.14): Project structure validation\n   234→\n   235→---\n   236→\n   237→## Session: Config Validation (cub-eke.13)\n   238→\n   239→### Task Completed\n   240→Implemented comprehensive configuration validation for the 'cub doctor' command.\n   241→\n   242→### What Was Implemented\n   243→\n   244→1. **JSON Validation**\n   245→   - `_doctor_validate_json()`: Checks if config files are valid JSON using jq\n   246→   - Handles both global (~/.config/cub/config.json) and project (.cub.json) configs\n   247→\n   248→2. **Required Fields Check**\n   249→   - `_doctor_check_required_fields()`: Validates presence of required config keys\n   250→   - Uses jq's `has()` function to check top-level fields\n   251→   - Outputs list of missing fields on failure\n   252→\n   253→3. **Deprecated Options Detection**\n   254→   - `_doctor_check_deprecated_options()`: Scans for deprecated config options\n   255→   - Maps deprecated keys to migration instructions\n   256→   - Initial deprecated options:\n   257→     - `harness.priority` → Use `harness.default` instead\n   258→     - `budget.tokens` → Use `budget.max_tokens_per_task` instead\n   259→     - `state.clean` → Use `state.require_clean` instead\n   260→\n   261→4. **Integration into cub doctor**\n   262→   - Config validation runs as part of standard diagnostics\n   263→   - Outputs clear [OK], [!!], or [XX] status indicators\n   264→   - `--verbose` flag shows detailed deprecation messages\n   265→\n   266→### Testing\n   267→\n   268→- Added 9 new tests to tests/doctor.bats\n   269→- All tests passing (32 total in doctor.bats)\n   270→- Tests cover:\n   271→  - Valid/invalid JSON detection\n   272→  - Empty objects and arrays\n   273→  - Deprecated option detection (single and multiple)\n   274→  - Required fields checking (missing and present)\n   275→\n   276→### Implementation Details\n   277→\n   278→**Key Design Decisions:**\n   279→1. Used jq's `has()` function to check for keys with dots (e.g., \"harness.priority\")\n   280→   - Avoids treating dots as path separators\n   281→   - Quoted field names properly in jq expressions\n   282→\n   283→2. Deprecated options stored as JSON map in function:\n   284→   ```json\n   285→   {\n   286→     \"harness.priority\": \"Use 'harness.default' instead\",\n   287→     \"budget.tokens\": \"Use 'budget.max_tokens_per_task' instead\",\n   288→     \"state.clean\": \"Use 'state.require_clean' instead\"\n   289→   }\n   290→   ```\n   291→\n   292→3. Functions output results to stdout for consumption by tests/shell scripts\n   293→   - Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on validation failure\n   294→   - Missing fields printed one per line\n   295→\n   296→### How to Use\n   297→\n   298→```bash\n   299→# Run standard diagnostics including config validation\n   300→cub doctor\n   301→\n   302→# Show detailed config issues\n   303→cub doctor --verbose\n   304→\n   305→# Dry-run any fixes (not applicable to config validation yet)\n   306→cub doctor --dry-run\n   307→\n   308→# See what would be fixed\n   309→cub doctor --fix\n   310→```\n   311→\n   312→### Future Enhancements\n   313→\n   314→The implementation provides the foundation for:\n   315→1. Auto-fixing deprecated options (could write migration advice to .cub.json)\n   316→2. Config file generation during `cub init`\n   317→3. Config schema validation against expected structure\n   318→4. Runtime config consistency checks\n   319→\n   320→### Files Modified\n   321→- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added 3 helper functions and integrated into main check\n   322→- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 9 comprehensive tests\n   323→\n   324→### Commit\n   325→e3b4d04 task(cub-eke.13): Config validation\n   326→\n   327→## Session: v0.19 Git Workflow Integration (cub-vd6)\n   328→\n   329→### Summary\n   330→Implemented comprehensive git workflow integration for cub v0.19, adding branch-epic bindings, checkpoint/gate support, and PR management.\n   331→\n   332→### What Was Implemented\n   333→\n   334→**Branch Management:**\n   335→- `lib/branches.sh` -

Header explaining purpose (persistent lessons from previous runs)\n   508→  - Project-Specific section for manual guidelines\n   509→  - Learned from Failures section for recording lessons from actual failures\n   510→- Includes example format for failure entries (date, task-id, error, lesson)\n   511→\n   512→**Modified `lib/cmd_init.sh`:**\n   513→- Added guardrails.md file creation in `cmd_init` function\n   514→- Placed after fix_plan.md and before README.md for logical grouping\n   515→- Uses layout_root variable to ensure correct placement in .cub/ directory\n   516→- Follows existing pattern: copy from template, check if already exists, log result\n   517→\n   518→### Key Implementation Details\n   519→\n   520→**File Location:** `.cub/guardrails.md` (in new layout)\n   521→\n   522→**Integration:**\n   523→- Follows established pattern used for progress.txt, fix_plan.md, and README.md\n   524→- Uses layout helpers (get_fix_plan_file, layout_root) for flexibility\n   525→- Skips creation if file already exists (idempotent)\n   526→- Provides success logging with log_success()\n   527→\n   528→**Testing:**\n   529→- All 238 existing tests pass\n   530→- Verified manually: cub init creates .cub/guardrails.md with correct content\n   531→- Template structure matches guardrails-system.md specification\n   532→\n   533→### Key Learnings\n   534→\n   535→1. **Template Pattern:** The cub init system uses a clean template-copy pattern for static files:\n   536→   - Templates stored in templates/\n   537→   - Copied to .cub/ (new layout) or root (legacy layout)\n   538→   - Skipped if already exist (safe for re-runs)\n   539→\n   540→2. **Layout Abstraction:** Using layout_root variable ensures compatibility with both:\n   541→   - New layout: `.cub/` subdirectory\n   542→   - Legacy layout: project root with symlinks\n   543→   - Current cub defaults to new layout but supports both\n   544→\n   545→3. **File Creation Ordering:** Logical grouping matters:\n   546→   - prompt.md - system prompt\n   547→   - agent.md - build instructions\n   548→   - progress.txt - session tracking\n   549→   - fix_plan.md - bug tracking\n   550→   - guardrails.md - institutional memory (NEW)\n   551→   - README.md - quick reference\n   552→\n   553→4. **Guard Clauses:** Each file creation uses consistent pattern:\n   554→   - Check if file exists with [[ ! -f \"$file\" ]]\n   555→   - Copy from template or generate content\n   556→   - Log success or warn about skipping\n   557→   - Prevents data loss from accidental re-runs\n   558→\n   559→\n   560→## 2026-01-14 - cub-3ge.7: Implement 'cub guardrails learn' interactive command\n   561→\n   562→### What Was Done\n   563→\n   564→Implemented interactive command `cub guardrails learn` that:\n   565→- Finds recent failures from .cub/runs/*/tasks/*/failure.json\n   566→- Displays them in numbered list with task info, exit code, error message\n   567→- Prompts user to select one or quit\n   568→- Uses AI (via guardrails_extract_lesson_ai) to extract actionable lesson\n   569→- Shows extracted lesson for review\n   570→- Prompts for confirmation before adding to guardrails.md\n   571→\n   572→### Implementation Details\n   573→\n   574→Added to lib/cmd_guardrails.sh:\n   575→1. `_cmd_guardrails_get_recent_failures()` - Finds failure.json files sorted by mtime\n   576→   - Cross-platform: stat -f (macOS) vs stat -c (Linux)\n   577→   - Returns up to 10 most recent failures\n   578→2. `cmd_guardrails_learn()` - Interactive workflow\n   579→   - Parses failure.json and task.json to get context\n   580→   - Displays formatted list with truncated error messages\n   581→   - Interactive prompts with validation\n   582→   - Integrates with existing guardrails_extract_lesson_ai and guardrails_add functions\n   583→\n   584→Updated cmd_guardrails_help() to document new subcommand\n   585→\n   586→### Key Learnings\n   587→\n   588→1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** When using stat for file times:\n   589→   -

Added guardrails retrieval via `guardrails_for_prompt()` call\n2. Guardrails are now injected as \"Lessons from Previous Runs\" section\n3. Section is placed before the \"CURRENT TASK\" section\n4. Section is only rendered if guardrails file exists and has content\n5. Clear formatting with section header and separator line\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**Integration Point:** `generate_task_prompt()` function (line 270)\n- Called whenever a task is about to be executed\n- Runs after task selection but before harness invocation\n- Ensures agents see institutional memory early\n\n**Guardrails Retrieval:**\n- Uses existing `guardrails_for_prompt()` from lib/guardrails.sh\n- Function returns formatted guardrails with header and guidance\n- Falls back gracefully if guardrails don't exist\n- Uses error suppression (`2>/dev/null || true`) for safety\n\n**Prompt Structure:**\n```\n## Lessons from Previous Runs\n\n[Guardrails content with institutional memory]\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT TASK\n\n[Task details as before]\n```\n\n### Design Decisions\n\n1. **Placement Before Task Details**: Guardrails appear first so agents absorb lessons before focusing on the specific task at hand\n\n2. **Optional Rendering**: Only included if guardrails file exists, preventing clutter in fresh projects\n\n3. **Clear Separation**: Separator (---) between guardrails and task details makes distinction clear\n\n4. **Minimal Changes**: Only 16 lines added, keeping the function clean and maintainable\n\n### Testing\n\n- Verified bash syntax: ✓ No errors\n- Tested `guardrails_for_prompt()` output: ✓ Properly formatted\n- Verified integration points: ✓ Function called correctly in prompt generation\n- Checked graceful fallback: ✓ Works with and without guardrails file\n\n### Files Modified\n- `lib/cmd_run.sh` - Enhanced `generate_task_prompt()` function\n\n### Commit\n1f8087e task(cub-3ge.4): Include guardrails in task prompts\n\n### Learnings\n\n1. **Prompt Injection Strategy**: Guardrails are most effective when placed at the beginning of task context, before specific task details. This ensures agents consider institutional memory before becoming focused on particular requirements.\n\n2. **Graceful Degradation**: Conditional inclusion of guardrails prevents breaking existing functionality for projects without guardrails files.\n\n3. **Separation of Concerns**: The guardrails system (files, parsing, formatting) is cleanly separated from the prompt generation logic, making both easier to maintain.\n\n4. **Integration Pattern**: When adding features that should inject content into prompts, wrapping in a dedicated function (`guardrails_for_prompt()`) is cleaner than scattering logic throughout the codebase.\n\n---\n\n## Session: Quick-Start Guide (cub-eke.16)\n\n### Task Completed\nCreated standalone quick-start guide for Cub - a focused 5-minute onboarding document.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**QUICK_START.md** - A separate quick-start guide covering:\n\n1. **Prerequisites (1 min)**\n   - Bash 4+, jq, Claude Code CLI\n   - Optional: beads CLI\n\n2. **Installation (1 min)**\n   - Clone to tools directory\n   - Add to PATH or create symlinks\n   - Verification with `cub --version`\n\n3. **Global Setup (1 min)**\n   - `cub init --global`\n   - Explains what's created\n\n4. **Project Initialization (1 min)**\n   - `cub init` in project directory\n   - Lists created files\n\n5. **Task Setup (1 min)**\n   - Two options: prd.json or beads\n   - Simple task examples for both\n\n6. **Running Cub (1 min)**\n   - Basic commands: `cub run`, `cub run --once`\n   - What Cub does step-by-step\n\n7. **Additional Sections**\n   - Check Status (cub status, cub explain, cub artifacts)\n   - Common Commands table\n   - Beads Commands reference\n   - Practical Tips for success\n   - Next Steps (links to detailed docs)\n   - Getting Help\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\n- **Minimal and focused**: 5-minute target, no overwhelming detail\n- **Separate from README**: Complements rather than duplicates\n- **Action-oriented**: Shows exact commands to run\n- **Two paths**: Both prd.json and beads support\n- **Quick feedback**: `run --once` option for testing\n- **Clear progression**: Setup → Initialize → Add Tasks → Run → Check\n\n### Why This Works\n\n1. **New users can get started immediately** without reading 30KB of documentation\n2. **Practical examples** (e.g., sample task in prd.json) reduce friction\n3. **Time estimates** (1 min per step) set expectations\n4. **Two-path approach** respects user preference (prd.json vs beads)\n5. **Safety valves** (`run --once`) let users test before committing\n\n### Files Created\n- `QUICK_START.md` - Standalone quick-start guide (182 lines)\n\n### Commit\naf4e7d9 task(cub-eke.16): Quick-start guide\n\n---\n\n## Session: Project Structure Validation (cub-eke.14)\n\n### Task Completed\nImplemented comprehensive project structure validation in 'cub doctor' command.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n1. **Symlink Validation (`_doctor_check_symlinks`)**\n   - Validates root-level symlinks for new layout projects\n   - Checks CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AGENT.md → .cub/agent.md\n   - Checks PROMPT.md → .cub/prompt.md\n   - Detects and reports:\n     - Valid symlinks (passing checks)\n     - Broken symlinks (pointing to wrong target)\n     - Regular files instead of symlinks\n     - Missing symlinks (optional warnings)\n   - Uses `readlink` to verify symlink targets\n\n2. **.gitignore Validation (`_doctor_check_gitignore`)**\n   - Validates .gitignore exists\n   - Checks for required patterns:\n     - `.cub/runs` - Session run artifacts\n     - `.bv/` - Beads viewer cache\n   - Detects missing patterns and reports them\n   - Uses grep with `^` anchor to ensure patterns are at line start\n\n3. **Integration into cub doctor**\n   - Both validations integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`\n   - Outputs clear [OK] and [!!] status indicators\n   - Non-blocking warnings (project can work without perfect symlinks/gitignore)\n\n### Testing\n\n- Added 8 new tests to tests/doctor.bats\n- All 40 tests passing in doctor.bats\n- Tests cover:\n  - Valid symlinks (single and multiple)\n  - Broken/incorrect symlinks\n  - Regular files instead of symlinks\n  - Missing .gitignore\n  - Missing patterns in .gitignore\n  - Complete .gitignore validation\n  - Edge cases (leading whitespace in patterns)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**Symlink Validation:**\n1. Only runs for new layout (`_PROJECT_LAYOUT == \"new\"`)\n2. Uses bash `-L` test to check if path is symlink\n3. Uses `readlink` to get actual target\n4. String comparison of targets (avoiding path resolution complexity)\n\n**Gitignore Validation:**\n1. Checks for file existence first\n2. Uses `grep -q \"^${pattern}\"` for exact line matching\n3. Accumulates missing patterns in array\n4. Provides detailed report of what's missing\n\n### How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Run standard diagnostics including structure validation\ncub doctor\n\n# Show detailed information\ncub doctor --verbose\n\n# View what would be fixed (currently informational only)\ncub doctor --dry-run\n\n# Check specific validations by examining output\ncub doctor | grep -A 10 \"Project Structure\"\n```\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\nThe implementation provides foundation for:\n1. Auto-fix of broken symlinks (--fix flag)\n2. Auto-generation of missing symlinks\n3. Auto-addition of missing .gitignore patterns\n4. Validation of symlink targets existence\n5. .gitignore comment/whitespace handling improvements\n\n### Files Modified\n- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added `_doctor_check_symlinks()` and `_doctor_check_gitignore()` functions, integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`\n- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 8 comprehensive tests for new validation functions\n\n### Commit\ne17d239 task(cub-eke.14): Project structure validation\n\n---\n\n## Session: Config Validation (cub-eke.13)\n\n### Task Completed\nImplemented comprehensive configuration validation for the 'cub doctor' command.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n1. **JSON Validation**\n   - `_doctor_validate_json()`: Checks if config files are valid JSON using jq\n   - Handles both global (~/.config/cub/config.json) and project (.cub.json) configs\n\n2. **Required Fields Check**\n   - `_doctor_check_required_fields()`: Validates presence of required config keys\n   - Uses jq's `has()` function to check top-level fields\n   - Outputs list of missing fields on failure\n\n3. **Deprecated Options Detection**\n   - `_doctor_check_deprecated_options()`: Scans for deprecated config options\n   - Maps deprecated keys to migration instructions\n   - Initial deprecated options:\n     - `harness.priority` → Use `harness.default` instead\n     - `budget.tokens` → Use `budget.max_tokens_per_task` instead\n     - `state.clean` → Use `state.require_clean` instead\n\n4. **Integration into cub doctor**\n   - Config validation runs as part of standard diagnostics\n   - Outputs clear [OK], [!!], or [XX] status indicators\n   - `--verbose` flag shows detailed deprecation messages\n\n### Testing\n\n- Added 9 new tests to tests/doctor.bats\n- All tests passing (32 total in doctor.bats)\n- Tests cover:\n  - Valid/invalid JSON detection\n  - Empty objects and arrays\n  - Deprecated option detection (single and multiple)\n  - Required fields checking (missing and present)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**Key Design Decisions:**\n1. Used jq's `has()` function to check for keys with dots (e.g., \"harness.priority\")\n   - Avoids treating dots as path separators\n   - Quoted field names properly in jq expressions\n\n2. Deprecated options stored as JSON map in function:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"harness.priority\": \"Use 'harness.default' instead\",\n     \"budget.tokens\": \"Use 'budget.max_tokens_per_task' instead\",\n     \"state.clean\": \"Use 'state.require_clean' instead\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Functions output results to stdout for consumption by tests/shell scripts\n   - Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on validation failure\n   - Missing fields printed one per line\n\n### How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Run standard diagnostics including config validation\ncub doctor\n\n# Show detailed config issues\ncub doctor --verbose\n\n# Dry-run any fixes (not applicable to config validation yet)\ncub doctor --dry-run\n\n# See what would be fixed\ncub doctor --fix\n```\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\nThe implementation provides the foundation for:\n1. Auto-fixing deprecated options (could write migration advice to .cub.json)\n2. Config file generation during `cub init`\n3. Config schema validation against expected structure\n4. Runtime config consistency checks\n\n### Files Modified\n- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added 3 helper functions and integrated into main check\n- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 9 comprehensive tests\n\n### Commit\ne3b4d04 task(cub-eke.13): Config validation\n\n## Session: v0.19 Git Workflow Integration (cub-vd6)\n\n### Summary\nImplemented comprehensive git workflow integration for cub v0.19, adding branch-epic bindings, checkpoint/gate support, and PR management.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**Branch Management:**\n- `lib/branches.sh` - Branch-epic binding library with YAML storage\n- `lib/cmd_branch.sh` - Commands for `cub branch` and `cub branches`\n- `.beads/branches.yaml` - YAML file for storing branch bindings\n- Auto-switch to epic's bound branch in `cub run`\n\n**Checkpoint Support:**\n- `lib/checkpoints.sh` - Checkpoint/gate detection and blocking logic\n- `lib/cmd_checkpoint.sh` - Commands for `cub checkpoints`\n- Integration with `cub run` to filter out checkpoint-blocked tasks\n- Support for `gate`, `checkpoint`, and `review` task types\n\n**PR Management:**\n- `lib/cmd_pr.sh` - Commands for `cub pr <epic-id>`\n- Auto-generated PR body from epic's completed tasks\n- PR number tracking in branch metadata\n\n### Key Learnings\n- BATS tests use `status` as a read-only variable - avoid naming variables `status` in library code\n- YAML parsing in bash is fragile - kept it simple with jq for JSON operations\n- Beads already supports `gate` type which is equivalent to checkpoints\n- Branch bindings should be 1:1 (one branch per epic, one epic per branch)\n\n### Files Added/Modified\n- lib/branches.sh (new)\n- lib/checkpoints.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_branch.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_checkpoint.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_pr.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_run.sh (modified - branch switching, checkpoint filtering)\n- cub (modified - new command dispatch)\n- tests/branches.bats (new - 27 tests)\n- CLAUDE.md (updated - documentation)\n\n## Session: Guardrails System - File Support (cub-3ge.1)\n\n### Task Completed\nImplemented full support for reading and parsing the `.cub/guardrails.md` file - the core data structure for storing institutional memory.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**Integration:**\n- Added `lib/guardrails.sh` sourcing to main `cub` script (line 75-76)\n- Guardrails library was already fully implemented (498 lines, 19 functions)\n- Library provides complete markdown file parsing and manipulation\n\n**Test Suite:**\n- Created `tests/guardrails.bats` with 39 comprehensive tests\n- Tests cover all 14 public functions:\n  - `guardrails_exists()` - Check file existence\n  - `guardrails_init()` - Create with template structure\n  - `guardrails_read()` - Read full content\n  - `guardrails_add()` - Append lessons with timestamps\n  - `guardrails_add_from_failure()` - Capture error-formatted lessons\n  - `guardrails_size_kb()` - Get file size (platform-aware Darwin/Linux)\n  - `guardrails_count()` - Count dated lesson entries\n  - `guardrails_check_size()` - Enforce size limits (default 50KB)\n  - `guardrails_clear()` - Clear with backups\n  - `guardrails_import()` - Import from other projects\n  - `guardrails_export()` - Export to shareable format\n  - `guardrails_search()` - Case-insensitive pattern matching\n  - `guardrails_list_json()` - Parse lessons to JSON array\n  - `guardrails_for_prompt()` - Format for task prompt injection\n\n**File Format:**\n```markdown\n# Guardrails\n\n## Project-Specific\n[Human-curated lessons and guidance]\n\n## Learned from Failures\n### 2026-01-14 - task-id\n**Error:** Description\n**Exit code:** N\n**Lesson:** Actionable guidance\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Automatic timestamp generation (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n- Optional task ID linking\n- Platform-aware file size checking (Darwin uses `stat -f`, Linux uses `stat -c`)\n- JSON parsing with regex matching: `^### ([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})(\\ -\\ (.+))?$`\n- Backup creation before clearing\n- Case-insensitive search with grep\n\n### Testing\n\nAll 39 tests passing:\n- 11 core functionality tests (init, read, add, exists)\n- 9 failure handling tests (add_from_failure, error formatting)\n- 8 file operations tests (import, export, clear, size)\n- 7 advanced feature tests (search, list_json, for_prompt)\n- 4 integration tests (custom directories, PROJECT_DIR env var)\n\nTest coverage includes:\n- File creation and initialization\n- Timestamp generation and formatting\n- JSON output validation\n- Platform compatibility (Darwin/Linux stat differences)\n- Regex parsing of lesson headers\n- Backup creation before clearing\n- Import/export across projects\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**Regex Pattern for Lesson Headers:**\n```bash\n^### ([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})(\\ -\\ (.+))?$\n```\n- Captures: date, optional task ID\n- Used in `guardrails_list_json()` to parse markdown to JSON\n- Handles both dated and task-linked entries\n\n**Platform Compatibility:**\n- Darwin (macOS): `stat -f %z` for file size\n- Linux: `stat -c %s` for file size\n- Both converted to KB with rounding up: `(bytes + 1023) / 1024`\n\n**Lesson Entry Format:**\n```\n### YYYY-MM-DD [- task-id]\n[Lesson content - can be multi-line]\n\n[Next lesson or section]\n```\n\n### Files Modified\n- `cub` - Added guardrails.sh sourcing (line 75)\n- `tests/guardrails.bats` - New test suite (39 tests)\n\n### How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Initialize guardrails for a project\nguardrails_init\n\n# Add a lesson from current session\nguardrails_add \"Always validate JSON responses\" \"task-123\"\n\n# Capture a lesson from failure\nguardrails_add_from_failure \"task-1\" \"1\" \"JSON parse failed\" \"Validate API responses are JSON\"\n\n# Get lessons formatted for prompt injection\nguardrails_for_prompt | head -20\n\n# Search for specific guidance\nguardrails_search \"validation\"\n\n# Export to share with another project\nguardrails_export ~/other-project/.cub/guardrails.md\n\n# List all lessons as JSON\nguardrails_list_json | jq '.[] | .content' -r\n```\n\n### Files Created\n- `tests/guardrails.bats` - 39 comprehensive tests (440 lines)\n\n### Commit\ntask(cub-3ge.1): Implement .cub/guardrails.md file support\n\n\n## Task: Update 'cub init' to create empty guardrails file (cub-3ge.5)\n\n### Task Completed\nSuccessfully implemented guardrails file initialization during project setup.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**Created `templates/guardrails.md`:**\n- Template file with standard guardrails structure\n- Contains three main sections:\n  - Header explaining purpose (persistent lessons from previous runs)\n  - Project-Specific section for manual guidelines\n  - Learned from Failures section for recording lessons from actual failures\n- Includes example format for failure entries (date, task-id, error, lesson)\n\n**Modified `lib/cmd_init.sh`:**\n- Added guardrails.md file creation in `cmd_init` function\n- Placed after fix_plan.md and before README.md for logical grouping\n- Uses layout_root variable to ensure correct placement in .cub/ directory\n- Follows existing pattern: copy from template, check if already exists, log result\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**File Location:** `.cub/guardrails.md` (in new layout)\n\n**Integration:**\n- Follows established pattern used for progress.txt, fix_plan.md, and README.md\n- Uses layout helpers (get_fix_plan_file, layout_root) for flexibility\n- Skips creation if file already exists (idempotent)\n- Provides success logging with log_success()\n\n**Testing:**\n- All 238 existing tests pass\n- Verified manually: cub init creates .cub/guardrails.md with correct content\n- Template structure matches guardrails-system.md specification\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **Template Pattern:** The cub init system uses a clean template-copy pattern for static files:\n   - Templates stored in templates/\n   - Copied to .cub/ (new layout) or root (legacy layout)\n   - Skipped if already exist (safe for re-runs)\n\n2. **Layout Abstraction:** Using layout_root variable ensures compatibility with both:\n   - New layout: `.cub/` subdirectory\n   - Legacy layout: project root with symlinks\n   - Current cub defaults to new layout but supports both\n\n3. **File Creation Ordering:** Logical grouping matters:\n   - prompt.md - system prompt\n   - agent.md - build instructions\n   - progress.txt - session tracking\n   - fix_plan.md - bug tracking\n   - guardrails.md - institutional memory (NEW)\n   - README.md - quick reference\n\n4. **Guard Clauses:** Each file creation uses consistent pattern:\n   - Check if file exists with [[ ! -f \"$file\" ]]\n   - Copy from template or generate content\n   - Log success or warn about skipping\n   - Prevents data loss from accidental re-runs\n\n\n## 2026-01-14 - cub-3ge.7: Implement 'cub guardrails learn' interactive command\n\n### What Was Done\n\nImplemented interactive command `cub guardrails learn` that:\n- Finds recent failures from .cub/runs/*/tasks/*/failure.json\n- Displays them in numbered list with task info, exit code, error message\n- Prompts user to select one or quit\n- Uses AI (via guardrails_extract_lesson_ai) to extract actionable lesson\n- Shows extracted lesson for review\n- Prompts for confirmation before adding to guardrails.md\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nAdded to lib/cmd_guardrails.sh:\n1. `_cmd_guardrails_get_recent_failures()` - Finds failure.json files sorted by mtime\n   - Cross-platform: stat -f (macOS) vs stat -c (Linux)\n   - Returns up to 10 most recent failures\n2. `cmd_guardrails_learn()` - Interactive workflow\n   - Parses failure.json and task.json to get context\n   - Displays formatted list with truncated error messages\n   - Interactive prompts with validation\n   - Integrates with existing guardrails_extract_lesson_ai and guardrails_add functions\n\nUpdated cmd_guardrails_help() to document new subcommand\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** When using stat for file times:\n   - macOS: stat -f \"%m %N\" (modification time + name)\n   - Linux: stat -c \"%Y %n\" (same but different flags)\n   - Check with [[ \"$(uname)\" == \"Darwin\" ]]\n\n2. **Global Variables:** Command modules use CUB_DIR not SCRIPT_DIR:\n   - Source libs: source \"${CUB_DIR}/lib/guardrails.sh\"\n   - PROJECT_DIR is available for project-specific paths\n\n3. **Interactive UX Pattern:**\n   - Display numbered list (1-indexed for users)\n   - Offer 'q' to quit at selection\n   - Validate numeric input is in range\n   - Show preview before confirmation\n   - Use y/n confirmation for destructive actions\n\n4. **Data Piping Pattern:** Use process substitution for reading find results:\n   ```bash\n   while IFS= read -r failure_file; do\n       failures+=(\"$failure_file\")\n   done < <(_cmd_guardrails_get_recent_failures 10)\n   ```\n\n5. **Array Indexing:** Bash arrays are 0-indexed internally, display 1-indexed for users:\n   - Display: i=1, i++ for each item\n   - Access: selected_index=$((selection - 1))\n\n### Testing\n\n- All 49 guardrails.bats tests pass\n- Manual test confirms:\n  - Finds failure.json files correctly\n  - Displays formatted list\n  - Handles 'q' to quit\n  - Validates numeric input\n  - Integrates with existing AI extraction\n\n","numLines":625,"startLine":1,"totalLines":625}}}

Added guardrails retrieval via `guardrails_for_prompt()` call\n2. Guardrails are now injected as \"Lessons from Previous Runs\" section\n3. Section is placed before the \"CURRENT TASK\" section\n4. Section is only rendered if guardrails file exists and has content\n5. Clear formatting with section header and separator line\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**Integration Point:** `generate_task_prompt()` function (line 270)\n- Called whenever a task is about to be executed\n- Runs after task selection but before harness invocation\n- Ensures agents see institutional memory early\n\n**Guardrails Retrieval:**\n- Uses existing `guardrails_for_prompt()` from lib/guardrails.sh\n- Function returns formatted guardrails with header and guidance\n- Falls back gracefully if guardrails don't exist\n- Uses error suppression (`2>/dev/null || true`) for safety\n\n**Prompt Structure:**\n```\n## Lessons from Previous Runs\n\n[Guardrails content with institutional memory]\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT TASK\n\n[Task details as before]\n```\n\n### Design Decisions\n\n1. **Placement Before Task Details**: Guardrails appear first so agents absorb lessons before focusing on the specific task at hand\n\n2. **Optional Rendering**: Only included if guardrails file exists, preventing clutter in fresh projects\n\n3. **Clear Separation**: Separator (---) between guardrails and task details makes distinction clear\n\n4. **Minimal Changes**: Only 16 lines added, keeping the function clean and maintainable\n\n### Testing\n\n- Verified bash syntax: ✓ No errors\n- Tested `guardrails_for_prompt()` output: ✓ Properly formatted\n- Verified integration points: ✓ Function called correctly in prompt generation\n- Checked graceful fallback: ✓ Works with and without guardrails file\n\n### Files Modified\n- `lib/cmd_run.sh` - Enhanced `generate_task_prompt()` function\n\n### Commit\n1f8087e task(cub-3ge.4): Include guardrails in task prompts\n\n### Learnings\n\n1. **Prompt Injection Strategy**: Guardrails are most effective when placed at the beginning of task context, before specific task details. This ensures agents consider institutional memory before becoming focused on particular requirements.\n\n2. **Graceful Degradation**: Conditional inclusion of guardrails prevents breaking existing functionality for projects without guardrails files.\n\n3. **Separation of Concerns**: The guardrails system (files, parsing, formatting) is cleanly separated from the prompt generation logic, making both easier to maintain.\n\n4. **Integration Pattern**: When adding features that should inject content into prompts, wrapping in a dedicated function (`guardrails_for_prompt()`) is cleaner than scattering logic throughout the codebase.\n\n---\n\n## Session: Quick-Start Guide (cub-eke.16)\n\n### Task Completed\nCreated standalone quick-start guide for Cub - a focused 5-minute onboarding document.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**QUICK_START.md** - A separate quick-start guide covering:\n\n1. **Prerequisites (1 min)**\n   - Bash 4+, jq, Claude Code CLI\n   - Optional: beads CLI\n\n2. **Installation (1 min)**\n   - Clone to tools directory\n   - Add to PATH or create symlinks\n   - Verification with `cub --version`\n\n3. **Global Setup (1 min)**\n   - `cub init --global`\n   - Explains what's created\n\n4. **Project Initialization (1 min)**\n   - `cub init` in project directory\n   - Lists created files\n\n5. **Task Setup (1 min)**\n   - Two options: prd.json or beads\n   - Simple task examples for both\n\n6. **Running Cub (1 min)**\n   - Basic commands: `cub run`, `cub run --once`\n   - What Cub does step-by-step\n\n7. **Additional Sections**\n   - Check Status (cub status, cub explain, cub artifacts)\n   - Common Commands table\n   - Beads Commands reference\n   - Practical Tips for success\n   - Next Steps (links to detailed docs)\n   - Getting Help\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\n- **Minimal and focused**: 5-minute target, no overwhelming detail\n- **Separate from README**: Complements rather than duplicates\n- **Action-oriented**: Shows exact commands to run\n- **Two paths**: Both prd.json and beads support\n- **Quick feedback**: `run --once` option for testing\n- **Clear progression**: Setup → Initialize → Add Tasks → Run → Check\n\n### Why This Works\n\n1. **New users can get started immediately** without reading 30KB of documentation\n2. **Practical examples** (e.g., sample task in prd.json) reduce friction\n3. **Time estimates** (1 min per step) set expectations\n4. **Two-path approach** respects user preference (prd.json vs beads)\n5. **Safety valves** (`run --once`) let users test before committing\n\n### Files Created\n- `QUICK_START.md` - Standalone quick-start guide (182 lines)\n\n### Commit\naf4e7d9 task(cub-eke.16): Quick-start guide\n\n---\n\n## Session: Project Structure Validation (cub-eke.14)\n\n### Task Completed\nImplemented comprehensive project structure validation in 'cub doctor' command.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n1. **Symlink Validation (`_doctor_check_symlinks`)**\n   - Validates root-level symlinks for new layout projects\n   - Checks CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AGENT.md → .cub/agent.md\n   - Checks PROMPT.md → .cub/prompt.md\n   - Detects and reports:\n     - Valid symlinks (passing checks)\n     - Broken symlinks (pointing to wrong target)\n     - Regular files instead of symlinks\n     - Missing symlinks (optional warnings)\n   - Uses `readlink` to verify symlink targets\n\n2. **.gitignore Validation (`_doctor_check_gitignore`)**\n   - Validates .gitignore exists\n   - Checks for required patterns:\n     - `.cub/runs` - Session run artifacts\n     - `.bv/` - Beads viewer cache\n   - Detects missing patterns and reports them\n   - Uses grep with `^` anchor to ensure patterns are at line start\n\n3. **Integration into cub doctor**\n   - Both validations integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`\n   - Outputs clear [OK] and [!!] status indicators\n   - Non-blocking warnings (project can work without perfect symlinks/gitignore)\n\n### Testing\n\n- Added 8 new tests to tests/doctor.bats\n- All 40 tests passing in doctor.bats\n- Tests cover:\n  - Valid symlinks (single and multiple)\n  - Broken/incorrect symlinks\n  - Regular files instead of symlinks\n  - Missing .gitignore\n  - Missing patterns in .gitignore\n  - Complete .gitignore validation\n  - Edge cases (leading whitespace in patterns)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**Symlink Validation:**\n1. Only runs for new layout (`_PROJECT_LAYOUT == \"new\"`)\n2. Uses bash `-L` test to check if path is symlink\n3. Uses `readlink` to get actual target\n4. String comparison of targets (avoiding path resolution complexity)\n\n**Gitignore Validation:**\n1. Checks for file existence first\n2. Uses `grep -q \"^${pattern}\"` for exact line matching\n3. Accumulates missing patterns in array\n4. Provides detailed report of what's missing\n\n### How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Run standard diagnostics including structure validation\ncub doctor\n\n# Show detailed information\ncub doctor --verbose\n\n# View what would be fixed (currently informational only)\ncub doctor --dry-run\n\n# Check specific validations by examining output\ncub doctor | grep -A 10 \"Project Structure\"\n```\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\nThe implementation provides foundation for:\n1. Auto-fix of broken symlinks (--fix flag)\n2. Auto-generation of missing symlinks\n3. Auto-addition of missing .gitignore patterns\n4. Validation of symlink targets existence\n5. .gitignore comment/whitespace handling improvements\n\n### Files Modified\n- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added `_doctor_check_symlinks()` and `_doctor_check_gitignore()` functions, integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`\n- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 8 comprehensive tests for new validation functions\n\n### Commit\ne17d239 task(cub-eke.14): Project structure validation\n\n---\n\n## Session: Config Validation (cub-eke.13)\n\n### Task Completed\nImplemented comprehensive configuration validation for the 'cub doctor' command.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n1. **JSON Validation**\n   - `_doctor_validate_json()`: Checks if config files are valid JSON using jq\n   - Handles both global (~/.config/cub/config.json) and project (.cub.json) configs\n\n2. **Required Fields Check**\n   - `_doctor_check_required_fields()`: Validates presence of required config keys\n   - Uses jq's `has()` function to check top-level fields\n   - Outputs list of missing fields on failure\n\n3. **Deprecated Options Detection**\n   - `_doctor_check_deprecated_options()`: Scans for deprecated config options\n   - Maps deprecated keys to migration instructions\n   - Initial deprecated options:\n     - `harness.priority` → Use `harness.default` instead\n     - `budget.tokens` → Use `budget.max_tokens_per_task` instead\n     - `state.clean` → Use `state.require_clean` instead\n\n4. **Integration into cub doctor**\n   - Config validation runs as part of standard diagnostics\n   - Outputs clear [OK], [!!], or [XX] status indicators\n   - `--verbose` flag shows detailed deprecation messages\n\n### Testing\n\n- Added 9 new tests to tests/doctor.bats\n- All tests passing (32 total in doctor.bats)\n- Tests cover:\n  - Valid/invalid JSON detection\n  - Empty objects and arrays\n  - Deprecated option detection (single and multiple)\n  - Required fields checking (missing and present)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**Key Design Decisions:**\n1. Used jq's `has()` function to check for keys with dots (e.g., \"harness.priority\")\n   - Avoids treating dots as path separators\n   - Quoted field names properly in jq expressions\n\n2. Deprecated options stored as JSON map in function:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"harness.priority\": \"Use 'harness.default' instead\",\n     \"budget.tokens\": \"Use 'budget.max_tokens_per_task' instead\",\n     \"state.clean\": \"Use 'state.require_clean' instead\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Functions output results to stdout for consumption by tests/shell scripts\n   - Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on validation failure\n   - Missing fields printed one per line\n\n### How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Run standard diagnostics including config validation\ncub doctor\n\n# Show detailed config issues\ncub doctor --verbose\n\n# Dry-run any fixes (not applicable to config validation yet)\ncub doctor --dry-run\n\n# See what would be fixed\ncub doctor --fix\n```\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\nThe implementation provides the foundation for:\n1. Auto-fixing deprecated options (could write migration advice to .cub.json)\n2. Config file generation during `cub init`\n3. Config schema validation against expected structure\n4. Runtime config consistency checks\n\n### Files Modified\n- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added 3 helper functions and integrated into main check\n- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 9 comprehensive tests\n\n### Commit\ne3b4d04 task(cub-eke.13): Config validation\n\n## Session: v0.19 Git Workflow Integration (cub-vd6)\n\n### Summary\nImplemented comprehensive git workflow integration for cub v0.19, adding branch-epic bindings, checkpoint/gate support, and PR management.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**Branch Management:**\n- `lib/branches.sh` - Branch-epic binding library with YAML storage\n- `lib/cmd_branch.sh` - Commands for `cub branch` and `cub branches`\n- `.beads/branches.yaml` - YAML file for storing branch bindings\n- Auto-switch to epic's bound branch in `cub run`\n\n**Checkpoint Support:**\n- `lib/checkpoints.sh` - Checkpoint/gate detection and blocking logic\n- `lib/cmd_checkpoint.sh` - Commands for `cub checkpoints`\n- Integration with `cub run` to filter out checkpoint-blocked tasks\n- Support for `gate`, `checkpoint`, and `review` task types\n\n**PR Management:**\n- `lib/cmd_pr.sh` - Commands for `cub pr <epic-id>`\n- Auto-generated PR body from epic's completed tasks\n- PR number tracking in branch metadata\n\n### Key Learnings\n- BATS tests use `status` as a read-only variable - avoid naming variables `status` in library code\n- YAML parsing in bash is fragile - kept it simple with jq for JSON operations\n- Beads already supports `gate` type which is equivalent to checkpoints\n- Branch bindings should be 1:1 (one branch per epic, one epic per branch)\n\n### Files Added/Modified\n- lib/branches.sh (new)\n- lib/checkpoints.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_branch.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_checkpoint.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_pr.sh (new)\n- lib/cmd_run.sh (modified - branch switching, checkpoint filtering)\n- cub (modified - new command dispatch)\n- tests/branches.bats (new - 27 tests)\n- CLAUDE.md (updated - documentation)\n\n## Session: Guardrails System - File Support (cub-3ge.1)\n\n### Task Completed\nImplemented full support for reading and parsing the `.cub/guardrails.md` file - the core data structure for storing institutional memory.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**Integration:**\n- Added `lib/guardrails.sh` sourcing to main `cub` script (line 75-76)\n- Guardrails library was already fully implemented (498 lines, 19 functions)\n- Library provides complete markdown file parsing and manipulation\n\n**Test Suite:**\n- Created `tests/guardrails.bats` with 39 comprehensive tests\n- Tests cover all 14 public functions:\n  - `guardrails_exists()` - Check file existence\n  - `guardrails_init()` - Create with template structure\n  - `guardrails_read()` - Read full content\n  - `guardrails_add()` - Append lessons with timestamps\n  - `guardrails_add_from_failure()` - Capture error-formatted lessons\n  - `guardrails_size_kb()` - Get file size (platform-aware Darwin/Linux)\n  - `guardrails_count()` - Count dated lesson entries\n  - `guardrails_check_size()` - Enforce size limits (default 50KB)\n  - `guardrails_clear()` - Clear with backups\n  - `guardrails_import()` - Import from other projects\n  - `guardrails_export()` - Export to shareable format\n  - `guardrails_search()` - Case-insensitive pattern matching\n  - `guardrails_list_json()` - Parse lessons to JSON array\n  - `guardrails_for_prompt()` - Format for task prompt injection\n\n**File Format:**\n```markdown\n# Guardrails\n\n## Project-Specific\n[Human-curated lessons and guidance]\n\n## Learned from Failures\n### 2026-01-14 - task-id\n**Error:** Description\n**Exit code:** N\n**Lesson:** Actionable guidance\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Automatic timestamp generation (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n- Optional task ID linking\n- Platform-aware file size checking (Darwin uses `stat -f`, Linux uses `stat -c`)\n- JSON parsing with regex matching: `^### ([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})(\\ -\\ (.+))?$`\n- Backup creation before clearing\n- Case-insensitive search with grep\n\n### Testing\n\nAll 39 tests passing:\n- 11 core functionality tests (init, read, add, exists)\n- 9 failure handling tests (add_from_failure, error formatting)\n- 8 file operations tests (import, export, clear, size)\n- 7 advanced feature tests (search, list_json, for_prompt)\n- 4 integration tests (custom directories, PROJECT_DIR env var)\n\nTest coverage includes:\n- File creation and initialization\n- Timestamp generation and formatting\n- JSON output validation\n- Platform compatibility (Darwin/Linux stat differences)\n- Regex parsing of lesson headers\n- Backup creation before clearing\n- Import/export across projects\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**Regex Pattern for Lesson Headers:**\n```bash\n^### ([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})(\\ -\\ (.+))?$\n```\n- Captures: date, optional task ID\n- Used in `guardrails_list_json()` to parse markdown to JSON\n- Handles both dated and task-linked entries\n\n**Platform Compatibility:**\n- Darwin (macOS): `stat -f %z` for file size\n- Linux: `stat -c %s` for file size\n- Both converted to KB with rounding up: `(bytes + 1023) / 1024`\n\n**Lesson Entry Format:**\n```\n### YYYY-MM-DD [- task-id]\n[Lesson content - can be multi-line]\n\n[Next lesson or section]\n```\n\n### Files Modified\n- `cub` - Added guardrails.sh sourcing (line 75)\n- `tests/guardrails.bats` - New test suite (39 tests)\n\n### How to Use\n\n```bash\n# Initialize guardrails for a project\nguardrails_init\n\n# Add a lesson from current session\nguardrails_add \"Always validate JSON responses\" \"task-123\"\n\n# Capture a lesson from failure\nguardrails_add_from_failure \"task-1\" \"1\" \"JSON parse failed\" \"Validate API responses are JSON\"\n\n# Get lessons formatted for prompt injection\nguardrails_for_prompt | head -20\n\n# Search for specific guidance\nguardrails_search \"validation\"\n\n# Export to share with another project\nguardrails_export ~/other-project/.cub/guardrails.md\n\n# List all lessons as JSON\nguardrails_list_json | jq '.[] | .content' -r\n```\n\n### Files Created\n- `tests/guardrails.bats` - 39 comprehensive tests (440 lines)\n\n### Commit\ntask(cub-3ge.1): Implement .cub/guardrails.md file support\n\n\n## Task: Update 'cub init' to create empty guardrails file (cub-3ge.5)\n\n### Task Completed\nSuccessfully implemented guardrails file initialization during project setup.\n\n### What Was Implemented\n\n**Created `templates/guardrails.md`:**\n- Template file with standard guardrails structure\n- Contains three main sections:\n  - Header explaining purpose (persistent lessons from previous runs)\n  - Project-Specific section for manual guidelines\n  - Learned from Failures section for recording lessons from actual failures\n- Includes example format for failure entries (date, task-id, error, lesson)\n\n**Modified `lib/cmd_init.sh`:**\n- Added guardrails.md file creation in `cmd_init` function\n- Placed after fix_plan.md and before README.md for logical grouping\n- Uses layout_root variable to ensure correct placement in .cub/ directory\n- Follows existing pattern: copy from template, check if already exists, log result\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n\n**File Location:** `.cub/guardrails.md` (in new layout)\n\n**Integration:**\n- Follows established pattern used for progress.txt, fix_plan.md, and README.md\n- Uses layout helpers (get_fix_plan_file, layout_root) for flexibility\n- Skips creation if file already exists (idempotent)\n- Provides success logging with log_success()\n\n**Testing:**\n- All 238 existing tests pass\n- Verified manually: cub init creates .cub/guardrails.md with correct content\n- Template structure matches guardrails-system.md specification\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **Template Pattern:** The cub init system uses a clean template-copy pattern for static files:\n   - Templates stored in templates/\n   - Copied to .cub/ (new layout) or root (legacy layout)\n   - Skipped if already exist (safe for re-runs)\n\n2. **Layout Abstraction:** Using layout_root variable ensures compatibility with both:\n   - New layout: `.cub/` subdirectory\n   - Legacy layout: project root with symlinks\n   - Current cub defaults to new layout but supports both\n\n3. **File Creation Ordering:** Logical grouping matters:\n   - prompt.md - system prompt\n   - agent.md - build instructions\n   - progress.txt - session tracking\n   - fix_plan.md - bug tracking\n   - guardrails.md - institutional memory (NEW)\n   - README.md - quick reference\n\n4. **Guard Clauses:** Each file creation uses consistent pattern:\n   - Check if file exists with [[ ! -f \"$file\" ]]\n   - Copy from template or generate content\n   - Log success or warn about skipping\n   - Prevents data loss from accidental re-runs\n\n\n## 2026-01-14 - cub-3ge.7: Implement 'cub guardrails learn' interactive command\n\n### What Was Done\n\nImplemented interactive command `cub guardrails learn` that:\n- Finds recent failures from .cub/runs/*/tasks/*/failure.json\n- Displays them in numbered list with task info, exit code, error message\n- Prompts user to select one or quit\n- Uses AI (via guardrails_extract_lesson_ai) to extract actionable lesson\n- Shows extracted lesson for review\n- Prompts for confirmation before adding to guardrails.md\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nAdded to lib/cmd_guardrails.sh:\n1. `_cmd_guardrails_get_recent_failures()` - Finds failure.json files sorted by mtime\n   - Cross-platform: stat -f (macOS) vs stat -c (Linux)\n   - Returns up to 10 most recent failures\n2. `cmd_guardrails_learn()` - Interactive workflow\n   - Parses failure.json and task.json to get context\n   - Displays formatted list with truncated error messages\n   - Interactive prompts with validation\n   - Integrates with existing guardrails_extract_lesson_ai and guardrails_add functions\n\nUpdated cmd_guardrails_help() to document new subcommand\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** When using stat for file times:\n   - macOS: stat -f \"%m %N\" (modification time + name)\n   - Linux: stat -c \"%Y %n\" (same but different flags)\n   - Check with [[ \"$(uname)\" == \"Darwin\" ]]\n\n2. **Global Variables:** Command modules use CUB_DIR not SCRIPT_DIR:\n   - Source libs: source \"${CUB_DIR}/lib/guardrails.sh\"\n   - PROJECT_DIR is available for project-specific paths\n\n3. **Interactive UX Pattern:**\n   - Display numbered list (1-indexed for users)\n   - Offer 'q' to quit at selection\n   - Validate numeric input is in range\n   - Show preview before confirmation\n   - Use y/n confirmation for destructive actions\n\n4. **Data Piping Pattern:** Use process substitution for reading find results:\n   ```bash\n   while IFS= read -r failure_file; do\n       failures+=(\"$failure_file\")\n   done < <(_cmd_guardrails_get_recent_failures 10)\n   ```\n\n5. **Array Indexing:** Bash arrays are 0-indexed internally, display 1-indexed for users:\n   - Display: i=1, i++ for each item\n   - Access: selected_index=$((selection - 1))\n\n### Testing\n\n- All 49 guardrails.bats tests pass\n- Manual test confirms:\n  - Finds failure.json files correctly\n  - Displays formatted list\n  - Handles 'q' to quit\n  - Validates numeric input\n  - Integrates with existing AI extraction\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":5,"newStart":1,"newLines":86,"lines":[" # Cub Project Progress"," ","+## 2026-01-14 -

New `guardrails_add_with_provenance()` Function**\n   - Explicit function for adding lessons with complete provenance metadata\n   - Requires: lesson text, task ID, and error summary\n   - Structured format with all traceability information\n\n**2. Enhanced `guardrails_add_from_failure()` Function**\n   - Now creates structured entries with full provenance metadata:\n     - Task ID in header: `### YYYY-MM-DD - task-id`\n     - Exit code: `**Exit Code:** <code>`\n     - Error source: `**Source Error:** <summary>`\n     - Actionable lesson: `**Lesson:** <text>`\n   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code\n\n**3. Improved `guardrails_list_json()` Function**\n   - Enhanced to extract and parse error summaries from entries\n   - Returns JSON with: date, task_id, error_summary, and content\n   - Enables programmatic analysis and filtering of guardrails by source\n\n**4. Fixed `guardrails_learn_from_failure()` Function**\n   - Updated to use `guardrails_add_from_failure()` instead of generic `guardrails_add()`\n   - Ensures AI-extracted lessons include complete provenance tracking\n\n### Key Features\n\n✅ **Complete Traceability**: Each guardrail includes:\n   - When it was created (date)\n   - Which task failure generated it (task_id)\n   - What error occurred (error_summary)\n   - Why it was created (lesson)\n\n✅ **Enables Cleanup**: Can identify and remove obsolete guardrails from resolved issues\n\n✅ **Analysis Ready**: Query guardrails by error type, task, or source\n\n✅ **All Tests Pass**: 49 guardrails tests passing, including updated test for new format\n\n✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing guardrails without provenance continue to work\n\n### Files Modified\n\n- `lib/guardrails.sh` - 96 lines added/changed for provenance functions\n- `tests/guardrails.bats` - Updated test to verify new format\n- `progress.txt` - Documented learnings\n\n### Commits\n\n1. **1d2f16f** - `task(cub-3ge.8): Link guardrails to source tasks/failures`\n2. **f2055a7** - `doc: Append cub-3ge.8 learnings to progress.txt`","session_id":"fe66b07e-e14b-458f-9bc9-f699ec7283c5","total_cost_usd":0.5790977499999996,"usage":{"input_tokens":8264,"cache_creation_input_tokens":64504,"cache_read_input_tokens":2826333,"output_tokens":14161,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":64504}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":41708,"outputTokens":17893,"cacheReadInputTokens":3071885,"cacheCreationInputTokens":112589,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.5790977499999996,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"1ae55a9d-2f0d-424b-a02b-12b2bc85285d"}
