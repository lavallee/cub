I'll help you move the review reporter rendering to the CLI layer. Let me start by understanding the current state of the codebase.Let me search for review-related files in the correct locations:Now let me explore the review directory structure:Perfect! Now let me check if there's already a CLI review directory structure:Good! Now let me check if there are any tests for the reporter:Let me check the test file to understand how the reporter is tested:Now I have a clear understanding. Let me analyze the current structure:

**Analysis:**
1. `reporter.py` has ~280 lines, mostly Rich rendering code
2. The data models are well-defined in `models.py`
3. The reporter has:
   - Helper functions for styling (`_grade_style`, `_grade_badge`, `_severity_style`)
   - A `ReviewReporter` class with:
     - `render_task_assessment()` - rendering logic
     - `render_epic_assessment()` - rendering logic
     - `render_plan_assessment()` - rendering logic
     - `_render_issues()` - rendering logic
     - `_render_recommendations()` - rendering logic
     - `to_json()` - data serialization (keep in core)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create `cli/review/` directory and `display.py` file
2. Move all Rich rendering logic to `cli/review/display.py`
3. Keep `to_json()` method logic (but probably move to a formatter in core)
4. Update `cli/review.py` to import from display instead of reporter
5. Update `core/review/__init__.py` to remove ReviewReporter export
6. Delete or gut `core/review/reporter.py`
7. Update tests

Let me start implementing:Now, let me create a formatter in core for the `to_json` method and update the CLI review.py:Now let me update the core/review/__init__.py to remove ReviewReporter and add the formatter:Now let me delete the reporter.py file since all its functionality has been moved:Now let me verify the updated CLI review file and check for any other imports that might need updating:Great! Now let me run the feedback loops. First, let me check if there are any test files that need updating:Perfect! No tests were directly importing from reporter.py. Now let me run the feedback loops:Great! Now let's run lint and do a broader test run to make sure nothing else broke:I see the issue! The `cli/review.py` file is being imported as a module but it's being shadowed by the `cli/review/` directory. Let me check the CLI __init__.py:Let me see the imports at the top:I see the problem. When I created the `cli/review/` directory, Python now treats `review` as a package (directory) instead of a module (file). The `cli/__init__.py` is trying to import `review` which now points to the directory, not the file. I need to rename the `cli/review.py` file first, then move the directory. Let me fix this:Ah, both exist! Python is preferring the directory over the module. The solution is to either:
1. Move the content of review.py into review/__init__.py and delete review.py
2. Rename the directory to something else

Let me go with option 1 - consolidating everything into the review package:Now let's verify the tests work:Great! Now let me run the broader tests:Perfect! Now let me do a final comprehensive check on the review module and type checking:Excellent! Let me verify the file structure is correct:Perfect! Now let me verify that Rich is no longer imported in the core review module:Perfect! Rich is now only in the CLI layer. Let me run a final comprehensive test to ensure everything works:Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me verify the final structure by documenting the changes:Perfect! Now let me close the task and commit the changes:Perfect! Let me check if there are more tasks:Great! The task is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task Complete: cub-b1b.1 ✓

Successfully moved review reporter rendering to CLI layer, achieving clean separation between data preparation (core) and rendering (CLI).

### Changes Made:

**Created:**
- `src/cub/cli/review/__init__.py` - Typer commands (moved from review.py)
- `src/cub/cli/review/display.py` - `ReviewDisplay` class with all Rich rendering
- `src/cub/core/review/formatter.py` - Data formatting function (`to_json`)

**Deleted:**
- `src/cub/core/review/reporter.py` - Completely removed, functionality split between CLI and core

**Modified:**
- `src/cub/core/review/__init__.py` - Removed `ReviewReporter` export, added `to_json`

### Architecture:

**Core Layer** (`src/cub/core/review/`):
- ✅ **Zero Rich dependencies** - No Rich imports remain
- Data models in `models.py` (unchanged)
- Business logic in `assessor.py` (unchanged)  
- Data formatting in `formatter.py` (new, no Rich)

**CLI Layer** (`src/cub/cli/review/`):
- ✅ **All Rich rendering isolated** - Console, Panel, Table, Text
- Display logic in `display.py` - `ReviewDisplay` class
- Typer commands in `__init__.py`

### Validation:
- ✅ All tests pass (650 tests in review/CLI suites)
- ✅ Type checking passes (mypy)
- ✅ Linting passes (ruff)
- ✅ Committed with proper format

The refactor successfully enforces the desired boundary: core produces structured data, CLI renders it with Rich. This enables future service layers and interfaces to call core review functions without UI dependencies.
