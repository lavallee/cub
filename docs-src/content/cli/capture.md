# cub capture

Quickly capture ideas, notes, and observations for later processing into tasks.

## Synopsis

```bash
cub capture [OPTIONS] [CONTENT]
```

## Description

The `cub capture` command provides a fast way to record ideas, bugs, notes, and observations without interrupting your flow. Captures are saved as markdown files with frontmatter metadata for later organization.

**Two-tier storage model:**

- **Global captures** (default): Stored at `~/.local/share/cub/captures/{project}/`. These survive branch deletion and switching.
- **Project captures**: Stored in `./captures/` when using `--project`. These are version-controlled with your repository.

Captures can later be:

- Reviewed with [`cub captures`](captures.md)
- Organized into tasks with [`cub organize-captures`](organize-captures.md)
- Triaged and processed with [`cub triage`](triage.md)

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CONTENT` | Text to capture. If not provided, reads from stdin. |

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--tag TAG` | `-t` | Add tag to capture (repeatable) |
| `--name NAME` | `-n` | Explicit filename (without .md extension) |
| `--priority LEVEL` | `-p` | Priority level (1-5, lower is higher priority) |
| `--project` | `-P` | Save to project captures directory instead of global |
| `--interactive` | `-i` | Launch interactive capture session with Claude |
| `--no-auto-tags` | | Disable automatic tag suggestion based on content |
| `--no-slug` | | Skip AI-generated slug, use ID as filename |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message and exit |

## Tags and Categorization

### Manual Tags

Add tags explicitly with the `--tag` option:

```bash
cub capture "Add dark mode" --tag feature --tag ui
```

Tags help you filter and organize captures later.

### Automatic Tag Suggestion

By default, cub analyzes your capture content and suggests relevant tags automatically. Common auto-suggested tags include:

| Tag | Detected From |
|-----|---------------|
| `feature` | "add", "implement", "new" |
| `bug` | "fix", "broken", "error" |
| `refactor` | "refactor", "cleanup", "reorganize" |
| `docs` | "document", "readme", "guide" |
| `test` | "test", "spec", "coverage" |

Disable auto-tagging with `--no-auto-tags`.

## Filename Generation

Captures are saved with descriptive filenames:

**Format:** `{project}-cap-{YYYYMMDD}-{slug}.md`

**Example:** `myproject-cap-20260117-add-dark-mode-ui.md`

The slug is generated by AI from your capture content. Use `--name` to specify an explicit name, or `--no-slug` to use just the ID.

## Interactive Mode

Launch an AI-assisted capture session:

```bash
cub capture -i "New feature idea"
```

This opens Claude with the `/cub:capture` skill for guided exploration of your idea. The AI helps you:

- Clarify the scope and goals
- Identify edge cases
- Break down complex ideas
- Suggest related considerations

Requires Claude Code to be installed.

## Capture File Format

Captures are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: cap-042
created: 2026-01-17T10:30:00Z
title: Add dark mode to UI
tags:
  - feature
  - ui
source: cli
priority: 2
status: active
---

The app should support a dark color scheme that users can toggle
in settings. This improves usability in low-light conditions.
```

## Examples

### Quick capture from command line

```bash
cub capture "Add dark mode to UI"
```

Output:
```
[check] Captured as cap-042 (global)
  ~/.local/share/cub/captures/myproject/myproject-cap-20260117-add-dark-mode-ui.md
```

### Capture with tags

```bash
cub capture "Refactor auth flow" --tag feature --tag auth
```

### Capture with priority

```bash
cub capture "Critical bug in login" --tag bug --priority 1
```

### Pipe content from another command

```bash
echo "Meeting notes: discussed Q1 roadmap" | cub capture
```

### Multi-line capture from stdin

```bash
cat <<EOF | cub capture
Sprint planning notes:
- Focus on performance
- Address customer feedback
- Ship dark mode feature
EOF
```

### Custom filename

```bash
cub capture --name "sprint-planning" "Q1 2026 sprint goals"
```

### Save to project directory

```bash
cub capture --project "Ready for version control"
```

This saves to `./captures/` instead of the global store.

### Interactive capture session

```bash
cub capture -i "New feature idea"
```

Opens Claude for guided exploration.

### Disable auto-tagging

```bash
cub capture "Fix git merge bug" --no-auto-tags
```

### Simple ID-based filename

```bash
cub capture "Quick note" --no-slug
```

Saves as `cap-042.md` instead of generating a descriptive filename.

## Storage Locations

### Global Store (Default)

```
~/.local/share/cub/captures/{project}/
```

- Survives branch deletion
- Organized by project automatically
- Good for early-stage ideas

### Project Store

```
./captures/
```

- Version-controlled with repository
- Use `--project` flag to save here
- Good for team-shared captures

## Workflow Integration

### Capture-to-Task Pipeline

1. **Capture** ideas as they come
   ```bash
   cub capture "Improve error messages"
   ```

2. **Review** captures periodically
   ```bash
   cub captures
   ```

3. **Triage** to categorize
   ```bash
   cub triage --all
   ```

4. **Organize** into tasks
   ```bash
   cub organize-captures
   ```

### Import to Project

Move important captures to version control:

```bash
cub captures import cap-042
```
