 {"id":"curb-038","title":"Implement stop and move-on failure modes","description":"## Context\nStop and move-on are the simplest failure modes - halt entirely or skip and continue.\n\n## Implementation Hints\n\n**Recommended Model:** sonnet\n**Estimated Duration:** 25m\n**Approach:** Return different exit codes to signal behavior to main loop.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Implement failure_handle_stop(task_id, exit_code, output)\n2. Log failure and return code indicating 'halt run'\n3. Implement failure_handle_move_on(task_id, exit_code, output)\n4. Mark task as failed, log, return code indicating 'continue'\n5. Store failure info for later retrieval (for explain command)\n6. Update task artifacts with failure info\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Stop mode halts run immediately\n- [ ] Move-on mode marks task failed and continues\n- [ ] Failure info stored for retrieval\n- [ ] Task artifacts updated with failure details\n- [ ] Exit codes distinguish stop vs continue\n\n## Files Likely Involved\n- lib/failure.sh\n\n## Notes\nUse exit code 0 for continue, non-zero for stop.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:15:02.633149-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-10T20:20:05.63163-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T20:20:05.63163-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented stop and move-on failure modes with exit code conventions and failure info storage","labels":["complexity:medium","logic","model:sonnet","phase-5"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"curb-038","depends_on_id":"curb-E05","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:17:11.740621-05:00","created_by":"lavallee"}]}
