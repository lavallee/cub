## Original Capture

we should implement hooks for the release process. for instance, updating the website is a task specific to cub, not all apps/projects using cub. we should be able to register this as an action/activity that happens in this repo. we can couple this with moving what is currently in scripts/cut-release to a cub cut-release command
