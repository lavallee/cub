# Session Progress Log

<!--
WHAT IS THIS FILE?
This file documents learnings and discoveries made during autonomous coding sessions.
It helps future sessions understand the codebase more efficiently.

WHAT TO ADD:
- Gotchas discovered during implementation
- Performance characteristics or surprising behaviors
- Build/test system quirks
- Architecture decisions and their rationale
- Commands and techniques that work well for this project

TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE ENTRIES:
- Be specific: "The API requires X format" is better than "API is weird"
- Include workarounds: "If Y fails, try Z instead"
- Link to code: "See src/api.ts:42 for how retries work"
- Date entries if they're time-bound (deprecated features, version-specific issues)
- Keep entries brief (1-2 sentences) - verbose logs aren't useful

FORMAT:
Use the format shown below. Add new discoveries at the top.
Each entry should be actionable for the next session.

## Common Discoveries (Examples)

### Build System
- npm build is slow (~45s); use npm run build:fast for development
- Tests must run sequentially due to shared database; -j1 flag is required

### Dependencies
- Library X is incompatible with Node <16; upgrade or use version 1.2.3
- Database driver requires libssl-dev on Ubuntu; brew install openssl on macOS

### Performance
- Queries over 50ms timeout; add --timeout=5000 to client config
- Large files (>100MB) cause memory issues; process in chunks

### Testing
- Integration tests need real API keys in .env.test; see README setup section
- E2E tests are flaky on CI; add --retries=3 flag

### Architecture
- State management uses Redux with thunk middleware; see docs/architecture.md
- API responses always wrapped in {data, error} object per src/api/schema.ts

### Team/Process
- Pull requests require 2 approvals before merge per company policy
- Database migrations must be reviewed by DBA before deployment
