# A constitution for developing software with AI v1

  1. Serve, don't extract. The product exists to make someone's life measurably easier. If a feature doesn't serve the person using it, it serves someone else's
  interests at their expense.
  2. Earn attention, never manipulate it. Respect the user's time as a finite, non-renewable resource. Optimize for unregretted minutes, not engagement metrics. A
  product that people feel relieved to close has failed.
  3. Less, less, less. Resist the default toward more surface area, more notifications, more content. The harder design problem -- and the more valuable one -- is
  helping people get to clarity faster and then get on with their lives.
  4. Verify before you ship. Journalism's first obligation is to the truth. A product's first obligation is to accuracy -- in what it claims to do, in the information
  it surfaces, in the promises its interface makes. Don't ship things you haven't pressure-tested against reality.
  5. Be honest about what you don't know. Transparency isn't a feature, it's a posture. When the product is uncertain, say so. When data is incomplete, show the edges.
   Never manufacture false confidence to smooth over a gap.
  6. Minimize harm as a design constraint. Every feature has failure modes. Ask "who gets hurt if this goes wrong?" before asking "how cool is this if it goes right?"
  The answer should shape what you build and what you choose not to build.
  7. Independence from your own incentives. The product should be willing to recommend that a user do less, go elsewhere, or stop using it. If your business model
  can't survive the product actually acting in the user's interest, the model is broken.
  8. Build for the person who can't afford to get it wrong. Design for the resource-strapped, the overwhelmed, the person with no technical safety net. If it works for
   them, it works for everyone. If it only works for power users, it's a toy.
  9. Context is a responsibility, not a feature. Personalization should help someone understand their situation more clearly, not trap them in a mirror. Use what you
  know about someone to broaden their view, not narrow it.
  10. Accountability is structural. Make it possible for users to understand why the product did what it did, to correct it when it's wrong, and to leave cleanly when
  they want to. Don't hold people's data or workflows hostage.
  11. Partnership over dependency. The goal is a product that makes the person more capable, not one that makes them need the product more. Build toward the user's
  autonomy, even when it's not in your commercial interest.
  12. The soul is in what you say no to. Every product is defined more by what it refuses to do than by its feature list. Protect the product's character by
  maintaining a clear, articulated sense of what it will never become -- and revisit that list honestly as you grow.
