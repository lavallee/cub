# Cub Project Progress

## Session: Guardrails System - Task Prompt Integration (cub-3ge.4)

### Task Completed
Successfully integrated guardrails content into task prompt rendering, enabling agents to see institutional memory lessons before tackling each task.

### What Was Implemented

**Modified `lib/cmd_run.sh`** - Enhanced `generate_task_prompt()` function:
1. Added guardrails retrieval via `guardrails_for_prompt()` call
2. Guardrails are now injected as "Lessons from Previous Runs" section
3. Section is placed before the "CURRENT TASK" section
4. Section is only rendered if guardrails file exists and has content
5. Clear formatting with section header and separator line

### Key Implementation Details

**Integration Point:** `generate_task_prompt()` function (line 270)
- Called whenever a task is about to be executed
- Runs after task selection but before harness invocation
- Ensures agents see institutional memory early

**Guardrails Retrieval:**
- Uses existing `guardrails_for_prompt()` from lib/guardrails.sh
- Function returns formatted guardrails with header and guidance
- Falls back gracefully if guardrails don't exist
- Uses error suppression (`2>/dev/null || true`) for safety

**Prompt Structure:**
```
## Lessons from Previous Runs

[Guardrails content with institutional memory]

---

## CURRENT TASK

[Task details as before]
```

### Design Decisions

1. **Placement Before Task Details**: Guardrails appear first so agents absorb lessons before focusing on the specific task at hand

2. **Optional Rendering**: Only included if guardrails file exists, preventing clutter in fresh projects

3. **Clear Separation**: Separator (---) between guardrails and task details makes distinction clear

4. **Minimal Changes**: Only 16 lines added, keeping the function clean and maintainable

### Testing

- Verified bash syntax: ✓ No errors
- Tested `guardrails_for_prompt()` output: ✓ Properly formatted
- Verified integration points: ✓ Function called correctly in prompt generation
- Checked graceful fallback: ✓ Works with and without guardrails file

### Files Modified
- `lib/cmd_run.sh` - Enhanced `generate_task_prompt()` function

### Commit
1f8087e task(cub-3ge.4): Include guardrails in task prompts

### Learnings

1. **Prompt Injection Strategy**: Guardrails are most effective when placed at the beginning of task context, before specific task details. This ensures agents consider institutional memory before becoming focused on particular requirements.

2. **Graceful Degradation**: Conditional inclusion of guardrails prevents breaking existing functionality for projects without guardrails files.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: The guardrails system (files, parsing, formatting) is cleanly separated from the prompt generation logic, making both easier to maintain.

4. **Integration Pattern**: When adding features that should inject content into prompts, wrapping in a dedicated function (`guardrails_for_prompt()`) is cleaner than scattering logic throughout the codebase.

## Session: Quick-Start Guide (cub-eke.16)

### Task Completed
Created standalone quick-start guide for Cub - a focused 5-minute onboarding document.

### What Was Implemented

**QUICK_START.md** - A separate quick-start guide covering:

1. **Prerequisites (1 min)**
   - Bash 4+, jq, Claude Code CLI
   - Optional: beads CLI

2. **Installation (1 min)**
   - Clone to tools directory
   - Add to PATH or create symlinks
   - Verification with `cub --version`

3. **Global Setup (1 min)**
   - `cub init --global`
   - Explains what's created

4. **Project Initialization (1 min)**
   - `cub init` in project directory
   - Lists created files

5. **Task Setup (1 min)**
   - Two options: prd.json or beads
   - Simple task examples for both

6. **Running Cub (1 min)**
   - Basic commands: `cub run`, `cub run --once`
   - What Cub does step-by-step

7. **Additional Sections**
   - Check Status (cub status, cub explain, cub artifacts)
   - Common Commands table
   - Beads Commands reference
   - Practical Tips for success
   - Next Steps (links to detailed docs)
   - Getting Help

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimal and focused**: 5-minute target, no overwhelming detail
- **Separate from README**: Complements rather than duplicates
- **Action-oriented**: Shows exact commands to run
- **Two paths**: Both prd.json and beads support
- **Quick feedback**: `run --once` option for testing
- **Clear progression**: Setup → Initialize → Add Tasks → Run → Check

### Why This Works

1. **New users can get started immediately** without reading 30KB of documentation
2. **Practical examples** (e.g., sample task in prd.json) reduce friction
3. **Time estimates** (1 min per step) set expectations
4. **Two-path approach** respects user preference (prd.json vs beads)
5. **Safety valves** (`run --once`) let users test before committing

### Files Created
- `QUICK_START.md` - Standalone quick-start guide (182 lines)

## Session: Project Structure Validation (cub-eke.14)

### Task Completed
Implemented comprehensive project structure validation in 'cub doctor' command.

### What Was Implemented

1. **Symlink Validation (`_doctor_check_symlinks`)**
   - Validates root-level symlinks for new layout projects
   - Checks CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AGENT.md → .cub/agent.md
   - Checks PROMPT.md → .cub/prompt.md
   - Detects and reports:
     - Valid symlinks (passing checks)
     - Broken symlinks (pointing to wrong target)
     - Regular files instead of symlinks
     - Missing symlinks (optional warnings)
   - Uses `readlink` to verify symlink targets

2. **.gitignore Validation (`_doctor_check_gitignore`)**
   - Validates .gitignore exists
   - Checks for required patterns:
     - `.cub/runs` - Session run artifacts
     - `.bv/` - Beads viewer cache
   - Detects missing patterns and reports them
   - Uses grep with `^` anchor to ensure patterns are at line start

3. **Integration into cub doctor**
   - Both validations integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`
   - Outputs clear [OK] and [!!] status indicators
   - Non-blocking warnings (project can work without perfect symlinks/gitignore)

### Testing

- Added 8 new tests to tests/doctor.bats
- All 40 tests passing in doctor.bats
- Tests cover:
  - Valid symlinks (single and multiple)
  - Broken/incorrect symlinks
  - Regular files instead of symlinks
  - Missing .gitignore
  - Missing patterns in .gitignore
  - Complete .gitignore validation
  - Edge cases (leading whitespace in patterns)

### Implementation Details

**Symlink Validation:**
1. Only runs for new layout (`_PROJECT_LAYOUT == "new"`)
2. Uses bash `-L` test to check if path is symlink
3. Uses `readlink` to get actual target
4. String comparison of targets (avoiding path resolution complexity)

**Gitignore Validation:**
1. Checks for file existence first
2. Uses `grep -q "^${pattern}"` for exact line matching
3. Accumulates missing patterns in array
4. Provides detailed report of what's missing

### How to Use

```bash
# Run standard diagnostics including structure validation
cub doctor

# Show detailed information
cub doctor --verbose

# View what would be fixed (currently informational only)
cub doctor --dry-run

# Check specific validations by examining output
cub doctor | grep -A 10 "Project Structure"
```

### Future Enhancements

The implementation provides foundation for:
1. Auto-fix of broken symlinks (--fix flag)
2. Auto-generation of missing symlinks
3. Auto-addition of missing .gitignore patterns
4. Validation of symlink targets existence
5. .gitignore comment/whitespace handling improvements

### Files Modified
- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added `_doctor_check_symlinks()` and `_doctor_check_gitignore()` functions, integrated into `_doctor_check_project()`
- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 8 comprehensive tests for new validation functions

## Session: Config Validation (cub-eke.13)

### Task Completed
Implemented comprehensive configuration validation for the 'cub doctor' command.

### What Was Implemented

1. **JSON Validation**
   - `_doctor_validate_json()`: Checks if config files are valid JSON using jq
   - Handles both global (~/.config/cub/config.json) and project (.cub.json) configs

2. **Required Fields Check**
   - `_doctor_check_required_fields()`: Validates presence of required config keys
   - Uses jq's `has()` function to check top-level fields
   - Outputs list of missing fields on failure

3. **Deprecated Options Detection**
   - `_doctor_check_deprecated_options()`: Scans for deprecated config options
   - Maps deprecated keys to migration instructions
   - Initial deprecated options:
     - `harness.priority` → Use `harness.default` instead
     - `budget.tokens` → Use `budget.max_tokens_per_task` instead
     - `state.clean` → Use `state.require_clean` instead

4. **Integration into cub doctor**
   - Config validation runs as part of standard diagnostics
   - Outputs clear [OK], [!!], or [XX] status indicators
   - `--verbose` flag shows detailed deprecation messages

### Testing

- Added 9 new tests to tests/doctor.bats
- All tests passing (32 total in doctor.bats)
- Tests cover:
  - Valid/invalid JSON detection
  - Empty objects and arrays
  - Deprecated option detection (single and multiple)
  - Required fields checking (missing and present)

### Implementation Details

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. Used jq's `has()` function to check for keys with dots (e.g., "harness.priority")
   - Avoids treating dots as path separators
   - Quoted field names properly in jq expressions

2. Deprecated options stored as JSON map in function:
   ```json
   {
     "harness.priority": "Use 'harness.default' instead",
     "budget.tokens": "Use 'budget.max_tokens_per_task' instead",
     "state.clean": "Use 'state.require_clean' instead"
   }
   ```

3. Functions output results to stdout for consumption by tests/shell scripts
   - Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on validation failure
   - Missing fields printed one per line

### How to Use

```bash
# Run standard diagnostics including config validation
cub doctor

# Show detailed config issues
cub doctor --verbose

# Dry-run any fixes (not applicable to config validation yet)
cub doctor --dry-run

# See what would be fixed
cub doctor --fix
```

### Future Enhancements

The implementation provides the foundation for:
1. Auto-fixing deprecated options (could write migration advice to .cub.json)
2. Config file generation during `cub init`
3. Config schema validation against expected structure
4. Runtime config consistency checks

### Files Modified
- `lib/cmd_doctor.sh`: Added 3 helper functions and integrated into main check
- `tests/doctor.bats`: Added 9 comprehensive tests

## Session: v0.19 Git Workflow Integration (cub-vd6)

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive git workflow integration for cub v0.19, adding branch-epic bindings, checkpoint/gate support, and PR management.

### What Was Implemented

**Branch Management:**
- `lib/branches.sh` - Branch-epic binding library with YAML storage
- `lib/cmd_branch.sh` - Commands for `cub branch` and `cub branches`
- `.beads/branches.yaml` - YAML file for storing branch bindings
- Auto-switch to epic's bound branch in `cub run`

**Checkpoint Support:**
- `lib/checkpoints.sh` - Checkpoint/gate detection and blocking logic
- `lib/cmd_checkpoint.sh` - Commands for `cub checkpoints`
- Integration with `cub run` to filter out checkpoint-blocked tasks
- Support for `gate`, `checkpoint`, and `review` task types

**PR Management:**
- `lib/cmd_pr.sh` - Commands for `cub pr <epic-id>`
- Auto-generated PR body from epic's completed tasks
- PR number tracking in branch metadata

### Key Learnings
- BATS tests use `status` as a read-only variable - avoid naming variables `status` in library code
- YAML parsing in bash is fragile - kept it simple with jq for JSON operations
- Beads already supports `gate` type which is equivalent to checkpoints
- Branch bindings should be 1:1 (one branch per epic, one epic per branch)

### Files Added/Modified
- lib/branches.sh (new)
- lib/checkpoints.sh (new)
- lib/cmd_branch.sh (new)
- lib/cmd_checkpoint.sh (new)
- lib/cmd_pr.sh (new)
- lib/cmd_run.sh (modified - branch switching, checkpoint filtering)
- cub (modified - new command dispatch)
- tests/branches.bats (new - 27 tests)
- CLAUDE.md (updated - documentation)

## Session: Guardrails System - File Support (cub-3ge.1)

### Task Completed
Implemented full support for reading and parsing the `.cub/guardrails.md` file - the core data structure for storing institutional memory.

### What Was Implemented

**Integration:**
- Added `lib/guardrails.sh` sourcing to main `cub` script (line 75-76)
- Guardrails library was already fully implemented (498 lines, 19 functions)
- Library provides complete markdown file parsing and manipulation

**Test Suite:**
- Created `tests/guardrails.bats` with 39 comprehensive tests
- Tests cover all 14 public functions:
  - `guardrails_exists()` - Check file existence
  - `guardrails_init()` - Create with template structure
  - `guardrails_read()` - Read full content
  - `guardrails_add()` - Append lessons with timestamps
  - `guardrails_add_from_failure()` - Capture error-formatted lessons
  - `guardrails_size_kb()` - Get file size (platform-aware Darwin/Linux)
  - `guardrails_count()` - Count dated lesson entries
  - `guardrails_check_size()` - Enforce size limits (default 50KB)
  - `guardrails_clear()` - Clear with backups
  - `guardrails_import()` - Import from other projects
  - `guardrails_export()` - Export to shareable format
  - `guardrails_search()` - Case-insensitive pattern matching
  - `guardrails_list_json()` - Parse lessons to JSON array
  - `guardrails_for_prompt()` - Format for task prompt injection

**File Format:**
```markdown
# Guardrails

## Project-Specific
[Human-curated lessons and guidance]

## Learned from Failures
### 2026-01-14 - task-id
**Error:** Description
**Exit code:** N
**Lesson:** Actionable guidance
```

**Features:**
- Automatic timestamp generation (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Optional task ID linking
- Platform-aware file size checking (Darwin uses `stat -f`, Linux uses `stat -c`)
- JSON parsing with regex matching: `^### ([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})(\ -\ (.+))?$`
- Backup creation before clearing
- Case-insensitive search with grep

### Testing

All 39 tests passing:
- 11 core functionality tests (init, read, add, exists)
- 9 failure handling tests (add_from_failure, error formatting)
- 8 file operations tests (import, export, clear, size)
- 7 advanced feature tests (search, list_json, for_prompt)
- 4 integration tests (custom directories, PROJECT_DIR env var)

Test coverage includes:
- File creation and initialization
- Timestamp generation and formatting
- JSON output validation
- Platform compatibility (Darwin/Linux stat differences)
- Regex parsing of lesson headers
- Backup creation before clearing
- Import/export across projects

### Key Implementation Details

**Regex Pattern for Lesson Headers:**
```bash
^### ([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})(\ -\ (.+))?$
```
- Captures: date, optional task ID
- Used in `guardrails_list_json()` to parse markdown to JSON
- Handles both dated and task-linked entries

**Platform Compatibility:**
- Darwin (macOS): `stat -f %z` for file size
- Linux: `stat -c %s` for file size
- Both converted to KB with rounding up: `(bytes + 1023) / 1024`

**Lesson Entry Format:**
```
### YYYY-MM-DD [- task-id]
[Lesson content - can be multi-line]

[Next lesson or section]
```

### Files Modified
- `cub` - Added guardrails.sh sourcing (line 75)
- `tests/guardrails.bats` - New test suite (39 tests)

### How to Use

```bash
# Initialize guardrails for a project
guardrails_init

# Add a lesson from current session
guardrails_add "Always validate JSON responses" "task-123"

# Capture a lesson from failure
guardrails_add_from_failure "task-1" "1" "JSON parse failed" "Validate API responses are JSON"

# Get lessons formatted for prompt injection
guardrails_for_prompt | head -20

# Search for specific guidance
guardrails_search "validation"

# Export to share with another project
guardrails_export ~/other-project/.cub/guardrails.md

# List all lessons as JSON
guardrails_list_json | jq '.[] | .content' -r
```

### Files Created
- `tests/guardrails.bats` - 39 comprehensive tests (440 lines)
